The partnership will focus on institutional equities business, equity capital market deals, and distribution of asset management products. Daiwa sees India as a partner of choice in the current global economic and political order, with plenty of opportunities in the Indian economy. Seiji Nakata, President and CEO of Daiwa Securities Group Inc, believes that India is emerging as a preferred destination for Japanese companies. With global supply chain disruptions and the China+1 strategy, Japanese companies are increasingly looking at India as a potential partner. The Indian government's initiatives, such as the production linked incentive (PLI), offer interesting opportunities in the manufacturing sector for Japanese companies. Despite the chequered track record of Japanese joint ventures in India, the sentiment towards India is changing in Japanese corporate boardrooms. With confirmed growth and a growing middle class, Japanese companies and investors are considering India as a must-invest destination. The investment in Ambit is part of Daiwa's plan to strengthen its balance sheet and fund the growth plans of its businesses.|'Many Japanese cos see India as a partner of choice|Y|Japanese financial services firm Daiwa which recently announced its intentions to expand its presence in India through an investment in Ambit sees New Delhi emerging as a partner of choice for Tokyo in the current global economic and political order Seiji Nakata president CEO Daiwa Securities Group Inc told ET in an exclusive interaction.The 121-year-old Japanese company first entered India in 2007 by opening an office in Mumbai . However the Japanese group could not scale up its business in India . In 2013 it sold its Indian mutual fund business to SBI . Since 2017 it has been working with Ambit on mergers and acquisitions and also runs an advisory firm DC Advisory which provides mergers and acquisition advisory for tech companies . The investment in Ambit announced in May for a 15 stake  marks a new journey in India  for Daiwa which  sees plenty of opportunities in the Indian economy  said the senior executive.The Daiwa partnership with Ambit will see the two financial services firms work closely on their institutional equities business and equity capital market deals as well as on distribution of asset management products of Ambit . Funds will also be allocated to other Ambit businesses such as its SME lending NBFC .  In the current scenario where there are a lot of political issues across the world and economic instability in all of that we feel that India is really shining out . Not only has it grown economically but we have also seen a lot of political initiatives being taken by India . So in all of this situation when you look for one single large economy which can offer itself as a partner which will be able to sustain or handle partnerships with other countries India is the only country that emerges as that partner  said Nakata .  India currently is in a very important position economically as well as politically .  He added that he believes India offers  confirmed  growth in todays global scenario and that the countrys economy can grow at a rate of 7 for the next five to ten years at least .  India has so much potential and we felt that it is important that we need to strengthen and expand our business in India  said Nakata.Early Beginnigs  We started with an office in 2007 and at that time we came alone . However having done business in India on our own we realised that we came across several limitations for expanding our business and various difficulties so we came to this question that how can we really grow in India We believe that partnering with Ambit can help us expand in India  added Nakata.While Japanese companies initially have diversified in China and later in countries like Vietnam and Thailand in a post pandemic environment with global supply chain disruptions Nakata believes that Japanese companies are now increasingly looking at India as they evaluate their China+1 strategy .  The China+1 potentials that came up initially were Vietnam and Thailand and those were the countries where most Japanese companies ventured into . Unfortunately Vietnam for example did not grow as much as they had expected it to and the China situation is not getting better . So when it comes to China+1 many Japanese companies have started realising that the 1 can be India . We already have a Japan-India courier that exists and we can leverage that corridor  said Nakata.Manufacturing Initiatives Nakata added that the Indian governments initiatives such as the production linked incentive PLI will offer interesting opportunities in the manufacturing sector for Japanese companies . With a growing middle class in India Japanese financial services will also find a lot of opportunities to fund the growing needs of this Indian middle class.He believes that despite the chequered track record of Japanese joint ventures in India where several high-profile companies like NTT Docomo or Daichi Sankyo exited the country following protracted legal battles with local partners or losses looking at the current global environment the sentiment towards India is changing in Japanese corporate board rooms  When you are looking at such a large country where you are sure that there will be confirmed growth I do n't think that there is any corporate in Japan which can think of not coming into India . What we see of India today Japanese companies and investors must come to India must invest in India no doubt about that  said Nakata.Daiwas investment in Ambit is being used to strengthen the groups balance sheet and fund the growth plans of businesses such as its SME lending NBFC and its wealth and asset management business .

The conglomerate has held early-stage talks with foreign chipmakers to potentially become technology partners. Reliance sees merit in this move as it would help safeguard against chip shortages that could impact its telecom and electronic devices businesses. Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goal of making India a chipmaker for the world, the country's chip ambitions have faced setbacks. India currently does not have any chip manufacturing plants, although companies like Vedanta and Foxconn are considering building facilities. The collapse of a $19.5 billion venture between Vedanta and Foxconn and the slow progress of ISMC's $3 billion investment plans have hindered India's chip ambitions. With a market capitalization of around $200 billion, Reliance Industries is considered one of the best-positioned companies in India to venture into semiconductors. The conglomerate has deep pockets and expertise in working with the government. However, entering the chip manufacturing industry requires finding a tech partner, which is crucial for Reliance's success.|Ambanis Reliance explores chipmaking foray talking with potential partners|Y|Billionaire Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries has begun exploring a foray into semiconductor manufacturing a move that could address its supply chain needs and cater to growing chip demand in India two people familiar with its strategy said.The telecoms-to-energy conglomerate encouraged by the Indian government has held early-stage talks with foreign chipmakers that have the potential to become technology partners said one of the people who has direct knowledge of the plans .

Reliance whose interest in making semiconductors has not been previously reported did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Indias IT ministry and Prime Minister Narendra Modis office also did not respond to requests for comment.Modi has declared he wants his country to become a chipmaker for the world but those ambitions first laid out in 2021 have suffered setbacks . The country does not as yet have any chip manufacturing plants although Indias Vedanta and Taiwans Foxconn are both looking at building facilities.Reliance sees merit in getting into semiconductors as the move would help safeguard against chip shortages that could affect its telecom and electronic devices businesses the sources said . In 2021 for example the conglomerate delayed the launch of a low-cost smartphone it was developing with Google citing the chip shortage.Demand for semiconductors in India and globally is also increasing they noted . Indias government has forecast the domestic chip market will be worth $ 80 billion by 2028 compared with $ 23 billion currently.Reliance which has a market capitalisation of around $ 200 billion would be one the best-positioned companies in India to delve into semiconductors said Arun Mampazhy a former India executive at U.S.-based chipmaker GlobalFoundries .  They also have deep pockets and know how to work with the government  he said.But chip manufacturing is an industry that has historically been beset with boom and bust cycles and requires much expertise .  Getting a tech partner C/ as a joint venture or via transfer of technology is the make or eak point  for Reliance said Mampazhy.Setbacks for Indias chip ambitions have come despite the governments offer of $ 10 billion in incentives.A $ 19.5 billion venture between Vedanta and Foxconn collapsed in July even before it got off the ground as the two sides struggled to find a tech partner with Foxconn complaining that the project had not moved fast enough.Foxconn has since decided to invest in India without Vedanta.Plans by ISMC a venture between Abu Dhabi-based Next Orbit Ventures and Israels Tower Semiconductor to invest $ 3 billion in India have moved slowly after Intel sought to acquire Tower . Talks between Intel and Tower later collapsed.Reliance has for months been considering an investment of $ 300 million that would give it a 30 stake in the venture a third source with direct knowledge of discussions said.Next Orbit Ventures and Tower did not respond to requests for comment .|Reliance Industries|Technology|EconomicTimes|Sep 08, 2023, 02:29 PM |Reliance Industries, led by Mukesh Ambani, is exploring the possibility of entering the semiconductor manufacturing industry in order to address its supply chain needs and meet the growing chip demand in India.

Traders in grey market hubs like Delhi's Gaffar Market have started taking advance bookings with a promise of lower prices. The high price arbitrage may lead to more sales through grey markets and consumers purchasing units when they travel abroad. Increasing currency arbitrage between the dollar and the rupee and the customs duty of 22% on the Pro models, which are not made in India, are the leading causes for the steep price hikes in India. Dubai has become a preferred destination for purchasing iPhones due to the lower prices. Social media is filled with posts on how consumers buying iPhone 15 Pro series models in Dubai can recover the cost of travel with the savings. Apple has introduced more differentiation in the Pro models with industry-first features like the 3nm Apple A17 chip, titanium frame, faster data transfer speeds, and improved cameras. The Pro models are expected to benefit from the premiumization trend in India, especially among consumers who consider their phones as lifestyle statements and content creators. Apple's market share in India is expected to increase to 6-7% with a record shipment of 8-9 million units in 2023. The base model of the iPhone 15 is being made in India by Apple's contract manufacturer Foxconn and is expected to be available locally on the first day of sale. The Dynamic Island OLED display and 48MP cameras make the base model more popular this time, appealing to upgraders and switchers.

Last year, it took around a month for made-in-India iPhones to reach the market, but this year the lag is expected to be only a few days. Apple aims to initially cater to the local market and then start exporting the India-made devices, including to Europe and the US. Apple has been leading the way in driving mobile phone exports from India and has become the flagbearer of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for smartphones. Its contract manufacturers, Foxconn, Hon Hai, Wistron, and Pegatron, have committed to exports of Rs 61,000 crore in FY24. In the June quarter of FY24, iPhone exports from India crossed Rs 20,000 crore, constituting 35% of all electronics exports and 66% of total mobile exports. India's PLI scheme, launched when US-China tensions were high, has successfully attracted companies like Apple to manufacture locally. In 2022-23, Apple manufactured over $7.5 billion worth of iPhones in India, making it the largest mobile phone exporter from the country. This surge in iPhone exports has propelled electronics to become the fourth-largest exported item from India in the June quarter of FY24.|Indians could unbox iPhone 15 along with the world|Y|With India emerging as a key manufacturing base for iPhones Apple is aiming for a new milestone with the local launch of its latest model . The US smartphone major is working towards unveiling the iPhone 15 made in Foxconns Chennai unit mid-September narrowing the lag with the global launch to a few days if not a simultaneous reveal in India people aware of the matter said.Globally the iPhone 15 is scheduled to be out on September 12.Last year Foxconns factory in Chennai commenced manufacturing iPhone 14 within 10 days of the global launch while it took around a month for made-in-India iPhones to reach the market . This year the lag if any is going to be a few days as all preparations for mass production of iPhone 15 are well underway the people said . Apple expects the latest India-made devices to initially cater to the local market . Apple driving India phone exports Demand is likely to surge in India during the festive season . After December the company is likely to start iPhone 15 exports including to Europe and the US.Queries sent to Apple and Foxconn remained unanswered at the time of publication of this report.Trial production of the iPhone 15 started in China in June at Foxconns Zhengzhou factory experts said . Components started coming into Foxconns Indian facilities around the same time.The country already accounts for 7 of Apples global production from less than 1 prior to the start of the production-linked incentive PLI scheme for smartphones in 2021.Apple has been at the forefront of driving mobile phone exports from India and has emerged as the flagbearer of the PLI scheme for smartphones . Its three domestic contract manufacturers Foxconn Hon Hai Wistron and Pegatron have committed exports of Rs 61,000 crore in FY24 for the third year of the PLI scheme for smartphones.For now it is likely that Foxconn will be the only contract manufacturer to start iPhone 15 production in India . Pegatron will likely be making the iPhone 15 Plus trial runs for which are yet to begin at a later stage ET reported earlier.In the June quarter of FY24 iPhone exports from India crossed Rs 20,000 crore or roughly half of what it had achieved in all of FY23 and a surge of nearly five times on-year . The iPhone is ranked as the single largest contributor constituting 35 of all electronics exports and 66 of total mobile exports in the first quarter of FY24.In 2022-23 Apple manufactured over $ 7.5 billion of iPhones locally of which around $ 5 billion worth were exported to global destinations . This made Apple the single largest mobile phone exporter from the country and pushed Indias mobile phone exports to over $ 11.1 billion a 91 increase over the last financial year.Due to the surge in iPhone exports electronics became the fourth-largest exported item from India in the June quarter of FY24 as the category grew the fastest amongst the top 30 exported items . As production increases it is expected that nearly 80 of Apples phones will be exported from India say government officials.A few years ago India launched its PLI scheme when US-China tensions were at their peak and companies including Apple were looking for an alternative to China .

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/the-death-of-poetry-has-apple-lost-its-mojo-in-a-decade-of-stupendous-growth/articleshow/103663755.cms|Imran Chaudhri's Farewell Email; Underwhelming iPhone15 Launch; Loss of Creative Soul at Apple|Imran Chaudhri, a top software designer at Apple, wrote a farewell email to colleagues announcing his planned exit. The email alarmed Apple's bosses, who feared that it could be interpreted as a sign that Apple's best days had passed. As a result, Chaudhri was fired and did not receive his shares. The recent launch of iPhone15 left many Apple fans disappointed, as they felt it lacked innovation compared to previous iPhones. Despite Apple's description of the launch as a huge leap forward, with new design features and a 48MP main camera, many fans believe it failed to stand apart from its predecessors. After the death of Steve Jobs, Apple's focus shifted from innovation to business growth under CEO Tim Cook. This led to the departure of key designers, such as Jony Ive, and a decline in inspired creativity. Many argue that the decade from 2001 to 2010 was the era of innovation at Apple, while the following decade saw a lack of breakthrough products.|The death of poetry Has Apple lost its mojo in a decade of stupendous growth|Y|A heart-rending incident that happened at Apple in 2017 can be considered symbolic of how the company grew after its visionary co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs death in 2011 . Feeling creatively unfulfilled Imran Chaudhri a top software designer who had joined Apple in 1995 and was part of the teams that developed the iPhones multitouch technology and later Apple Watch interface started planning his exit . He told his bosses he would leave in a few months after collecting equity shares that he was due to earn as part of his compensation a normal practice at Apple.A month before leaving Chaudhri wrote a farewell email to colleagues announcing his planned exit . He was fond of quoting a line from the 11th-century Persian poet Rumi When you do things from your soul you feel a river moving in you a joy. Playing off that line Imran wrote Sadly rivers dry out and when they do you look for a new one.The email alarmed the bosses . In his 2022 book 'After Steve How Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost Its Soul NYT tech reporter Tripp Mickle wrote that they feared the message the email had sent .  They feared that the message Chaudhri sent could be interpreted to mean that Apples best days had passed  Mickel wrote .  Its river had run dry . It was one thing for outsiders to say that the company was no longer innovative but another thing altogether for that critique to come from someone who had helped birth multitouch technology for the iPhone . They worried it would poison morale and moved to contain the damage . Shortly after the email Dye fired Chaudhri .  Firing meant Chaudhri wo n't receive his shares . He later explained to friends that the email was a personal reflection on his own lack of joy not a comment on Apple.Mickels book which narrates the creative ain drain at Apple after Jobs death rings true when the recent launch of iPhone15 has left many Apple fans a bit disappointed .  Apples Wonderlust event may go down in history but not for good reasons  wrote Lewis Painter on Trusted Reviews .  Thats because despite the fact we saw four new iPhones and two new Apple Watches its probably the most underwhelming Apple launch in recent memory . Could the behemoth that is Apple actually be struggling to innovate While Id have baulked at the idea a few years ago today Im not so sure .  Though Apple has described the launch as  a huge leap forward for iPhone with a gorgeous new design featuring a durable colour-infused back glass and new contoured edge the Dynamic Island a 48MP Main camera with 2x Telephoto and USBC  many Apple fans think iPhone 15 lacks innovation that would make it stand apart from previous iPhones .  Meet the new Apple iPhone 13 I mean 14 no sorry 15  a user wrote on X . Another went so far as to say that innovation died with Steve Jobs roughly the point Mickle makes in his book though it sounds too exaggerated . Did poetry die at Apple after Steve Jobs It is a widespread belief that Apple under Steve Jobs did not just sell products to people to make money but was an inspired venture that prioritised innovation art and aesthetics over profits . Unconvincing though it may seem to many the belief is powered by the personal mythology of Jobs who grew to become a god of innovation as well as an inspiring icon for the masses.When a dying Jobs chose Tim Cook as his successor he had told Cook to chart his own path for Apple . And Cook did turning Apple into a $ 3 trillion company by market cap the most valued in the world . But many think the creative soul of Apple had been eclipsed by the machine as Mickle puts it in his book . The argument goes that as Apple focused on services notably music streaming production and supply chains innovation attenuated and several members of Jobs team of inspired designers Imran Chaudhri being one of them left the company and also took away with them the culture of innovation . Its argued that the decade from 2001 to 2010 was the decade of innovation at Apple when the company launched several products that became iconic such as the iPod the Macbook Air the iPad and the iPhone . However in the next decade after Jobs death the company went low on innovation not launching any eakthrough product but grew tremendously under Cooks able business leadership . Danny Costers was the first high-profile exit of a designer from Jobs times . Coster who led the redesign of the iPad and was instrumental in the design of the translucent iMac left Apple in 2016 frustrated with the increasing cost-consciousness at the company a sharp eak from Jobs times when money would flow freely for the design team . With Apples most famous designer and a trusted aide of Steve Jobs Jony Ive leaving in 2019 many saw it as the end of the Steve Jobs era at Apple.Cook versus IveThe argument about the loss of inspired creativity and the rise of a nifty business growth culture at Apple hinges on the uneasy polarity of two contrasting figures  Apples design leader and Jobs close confidant Jonathan Paul Ive or Jony Ive and Jobs chosen successor CEO Tim Cook . For two decades before he left in 2019 Ive had created the sleek and elegant Apple products that set the company apart from all others . As Apple grew under Tim Cook with its focus shifting to business from innovation as many including Mickle argue Ive no longer remained the presiding deity at Apple . Mickle tells the story of how Apple made money but lost its creative soul through Ives decline and Cooks rise at the company after Jobs death .  It was no exaggeration to say that his way of seeing his love of pure simple lines had already redrawn the world  Mickle writes about Ive in his book .  Yet he was never satisfied with his own creations noticing imperfections invisible to others such as a watch he considered a millimeter too thick or the infinitesimal gap where iPhone parts intersected . He saw poetry inside the machine . He found inspiration in the curve of flowers and the color of tropical waters . He considered imitation to be lazy theft not flattery . When he stood among the members of his team they felt as though any problem were solvable any eakthrough possible .  Cook was Ives polar opposite not an inspired artist but a savvy business leader .  He had risen through the ranks from the supply side of the company  Mickle describes Cook in his book .  His gift was not the creation of new products . Instead he had invented countless ways to maximize margins squeezing some suppliers and persuading others to build factories the size of cities to churn out more units . He considered inventory evil . He knew how to make subordinates sweat with withering questions . Though he had started as a wizard of spreadsheets he was rapidly distinguishing himself as a master politician who had forged global alliances with the presidents of both the United States and the Peoples Republic of China . A single sentence from his mouth could send the worlds stock markets into free fall .  And this is how Mickle describes the passage of the Jobs era at Apple by narrating Ives increasing irrelevance .  The truth was Ive had been slipping out of focus for years . Apple was no longer his beautiful creation . He was no longer the star of the show . The cameras no longer clicked for him and news anchors no longer invited him to wax poetically about design . The outside world wanted to know what the company was going to do about tariffs immigration and privacy . They wanted Cook . The creative soul of Apple had been eclipsed by the machine .  Those who think iPhone15 sorely lacks innovation would be convinced with Mickles thesis that its soul has been sucked out of Apple . But many would find it too simplistic to believe that any business organisation with the stated aim of making profits and growing its market should have a soul to begin with .|Apple|Technology|EconomicTimes|Sep 14, 2023, 04:46 PM |Imran Chaudhri, a top software designer at Apple, was fired after sending a farewell email that raised concerns about the company's future.

The government argues that RIL knew about the connectivity of its block with the adjoining ONGC block and deliberately extracted and sold the ONGC gas without the government's knowledge. Reliance Industries, through its counsel Sameer Parekh, has opposed the government's appeal, stating that the issues cannot be reopened under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. The lawyer argued that the migration of gas could have been studied by the ministry in 2009 itself, but they chose not to do so. RIL also claimed that it would have been infeasible to extract gas from the underdeveloped ONGC block at that time. The government is seeking to set aside the international arbitration award that ruled in favor of the RIL-led consortium. They argue that the award strikes at the heart of public policy and has given a premium to RIL, which they accuse of committing fraud and criminal offenses.

He highlighted that India is growing rapidly, and the electricity demand is increasing at a fast pace. However, if the round-the-clock renewable energy works out as planned, the need for thermal power capacity addition may be avoided. R K Singh revealed that India will soon launch a pilot project to produce 100 MW of round-the-clock power using green hydrogen as storage. He stated that India aims to become the largest producer and exporter of green hydrogen and ammonia globally, leveraging its substantial manufacturing capacity for green hydrogen. Singh emphasized that green hydrogen storage is cheaper than gas and battery energy storage, making it a viable option for future growth.

In August, power generation surged to a record 162.7 billion kilowatt hours, with coal's share in power output rising to 66.7%, the highest in six years. The government has defended the use of coal, citing lower per capita emissions compared to richer nations and rising renewable energy output. Despite higher demand for coal, power plants in India have slashed imports by 24% to 17.85 million metric tons during the first four months of the fiscal year. This is due to a 10.7% increase in production by state-run Coal India. Lower imports have kept global thermal coal prices depressed. The higher power use in India is attributed to farmers using more electricity for irrigation, intermittency of renewables, and increased cooling demand. India's peak electricity demand reached a record 243.9 gigawatts on August 31, exceeding available capacity by 7.3 gigawatts. In August, electricity supply fell short of demand by 780 million units, marking the highest shortage since April 2022. The shortage is attributed to poor monsoon, high agricultural demand, and the fall of wind generation. Weather officials expect country-wide rainfall in September to provide some respite. Coal's share in India's power output rose to 74.2% in the eight months ending in August, on track for a third consecutive annual increase. In contrast, the share of hydro power fell from 10.9% to 9.2%. Overall power generation has risen significantly, dwarfing the increase in renewable generation.

It is unusual for Indias electricity use to spike in August when temperatures are lower due to the annual monsoon that runs between June and September . Demand typically peaks in May when Indians crank up air-conditioners to beat the heat and industries operate without rain-related disruptions .

Low promoter holding hurdle It will also bag the top spot among Indian generic players in US and emerging markets.Such an entity will be a formidable rival to Sun Pharma the most valuable Indian player with a C/12.65 lakh crore market capitalisation . Bain declined to comment . DRL did not respond to ETs queries.However sources in the know said DRLs low promoter holding may act as a hindrance for pursuing such a large acquisition as raising leverage may lead to significant dilution of their stake . Currently the promoters of DRL Satish Reddy and GV Prasad and family own 26.69 . Torrents founders the Sudhir and Samir Mehta family hold 71.25 of their company as promoters . On the other hand unlike Torrent which is smaller in size and financials Dr Reddys sales and profitability in FY23 were higher than that of Cipla though the latters market cap has edged past in recent weeks after news of the promoters sale plan became known .

Complementary strengths Cipla and Dr Reddys have complementary strengths in geographical coverage analysts said . Cipla is dominant in India twice DRLs sales West Asia and South Africa . Dr Reddys has historical strengths in the US 1.8 times Ciplas US generic sales and Russia . In North America Dr Reddys largest market it clocked $ 1.2 billion sales in the last fiscal year.Product and segment overlap is minimal . Cipla is a market leader in respiratory ranked number two in urology and has been strong in anti-infectives as well as cardiac therapies . Dr Reddys major areas are gastrointestinal oncology cardiovascular pain management and respiratory therapies . A large share of the consumer health and trade generics business is also in play . Cipla has 20-plus ands in the top 300 in the Indian Pharma Market IPM while Dr Reddys has 16 in the same club . The combined entity can potentially generate a profit after tax PAT of C/19,000 crore in the next one year according to analysts who track the companies .  On the one hand both DRL and Cipla are professionally run set-ups with similar cultural ethos and there is minimal operational overlap with maximum geographical synergies  said a pharma analyst who did n't want to be identified.Cipla CEO Umang Vohra is a former Dr Reddys executive . Hes credited with having rebooted Cipla with a wide-ranging organisational revamp a marketing overhaul in the US and Europe new hires and a renewed focus on India through strategic alliances with global drug makers such as Roche and Novartis .  However with a low promoter stake and a large USA business and R D costs 8 of sales the markets may not perceive high acquisition leverage that may be required by DRL as a positive even if its current net worth is approximately C/123,000 crore  the analyst said .  This will drag the DRL stock down .  Top 5 club Long considered a US success story pricing pressure and regulatory challenges in the worlds largest generics market persuaded Dr Reddys to also increase its focus on India after contraction and stagnant ebitda margins in FY16-18 . The ebitda margin in FY23 has been 29.7 and analysts expect this to be sustained in the 23-25 range going forward . Dr Reddys aims to be among the top five drug makers in India largely driven by mergers and acquisitions M As co-chairman GV Prasad told ET in an interview last year .

As a result, around half a million metric tons of urea are held up at Chinese ports, causing delays in loading and inspections. Two Chinese state-owned urea producers have announced that they will prioritize domestic supply. This move further exacerbates the delay in urea shipments and inspections. The Chinese government has not provided any immediate comment on the situation. Around half a million metric tons of urea bought by Indian Potash Limited (IPL) are currently held at the Chinese port of Tianjin awaiting inspections and clearance.

Additionally, China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) has urged its subsidiaries to prioritize urea supply to the domestic market.

Our principle is simple diversity is our best bet whether in society or in terms of our energy mix  he told PTI in an exclusive interview here ahead of the G20 summit .  There are no one-size-fits-all solutions . Given the different pathways countries are on our pathways for energy transition will be different .  Coal oil and gas make up for almost two-thirds of the worlds energy consumption . And replacing them ca n't happen overnight . Given this New Delhi is in favour of continuing to invest in todays energy system so as to meet the demands of growing economies and not cause any shortage . And at the same time investments should flow into transition fuels .  Despite having 17 per cent of the worlds population Indias historic share in cumulative emissions has been less than five per cent . Yet we have left no stone unturned in meeting our climate goals  Modi said . India ramped up its solar energy capacity 20-fold in just a few years is now among the top four nations in the world in terms of wind energy and is playing an important role in both innovation and adoption of electric vehicles he said .  We are perhaps the first among the G20 countries to have achieved our climate targets nine years ahead of the scheduled date  he said . India has now pledged to reduce the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product GDP by 45 per cent by 2030 . It has set a target of 2070 to achieve net zero and towards that goal committed to generating 50 per cent of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 setting up 500 GW of renewable energy capacity and reducing the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes till 2030 .  So we are certainly on track while also tailoring in various factors needed to ensure growth  Modi said . On the future of the fight against climate change he said he was extremely positive about it and the country was working with other nations to  alter the approach from a restrictive to a constructive approach  .  Rather than focusing purely on the approach of do n't do this or that we want to ing in an attitude that makes people and nations aware of what they can do and help them with that in terms of finance technology and other resources  he added . Last year the world lost three per cent of gas demand following the Russia-Ukraine war and the prices went up seven-fold resulting in countries turning to the next cheaper alternative coal . India has been long pressing for a just orderly and sustainable energy transition where the energy needs of its fast-growing economy continue to be met and it is given access to technology and financing for a just and orderly transition to renewable energy sources like wind and solar as well as lithium-ion batteries .|India|Energy|EconomicTimes|Sep 03, 2023, 03:19 PM |Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emphasized the importance of diversity in the energy mix, stating that each nation should have the freedom to decide its energy transition pathway based on resource availability.

This breakthrough has allowed Tesla to slash production costs and develop cars from the ground up in a much shorter time frame compared to its rivals. The company's unboxed manufacturing strategy aims to produce large sub-assemblies of a car and snap them together, potentially disrupting the industry. Tesla's breakthrough in gigacasting, which involves casting large structures for EVs, centers around the design and testing of giant molds using 3D printing and industrial sand. These innovations have enabled Tesla to incorporate hollow subframes with internal ribs, reducing weight and improving crashworthiness. The use of sand casting with 3D printing allows for cost-effective design validation and rapid prototyping, significantly reducing the time and cost involved in the traditional metal mold process. One major hurdle Tesla had to overcome in gigacasting was the behavior of aluminum alloys in sand molds, which often failed to meet the company's crashworthiness criteria. However, casting specialists were able to formulate special alloys, fine-tune the cooling process, and implement after-production heat treatment to address this issue. Once Tesla is satisfied with the prototype mold, it can invest in a final metal mold for mass production. Tesla is considering casting the underbody of its upcoming small EV in one piece, which would simplify the manufacturing process. However, the choice of gigapress and the complexity of the car frame would need to be determined. Tesla would require new, larger gigapresses with high clamping power to punch out such large body parts quickly, but these presses may not be able to accommodate the 3D printed sand cores needed for hollow subframes. Alternatively, Tesla could use a different type of press that allows for slow alloy injection, which produces higher quality castings but takes longer.|Gigacasting 2.0 Tesla reinvents carmaking with quiet eakthrough|Y|Tesla has combined a series of innovations to make a technological eakthrough that could transform the way it makes electric vehicles and help Elon Musk achieve his aim of halving production costs five people familiar with the move said . The company pioneered the use of huge presses with 6,000 to 9,000 tons of clamping pressure to mold the front and rear structures of its Model Y in a  gigacasting  process that slashed production costs and left rivals scrambling to catch up . In a bid to extend its lead Tesla is closing in on an innovation that would allow it to die cast nearly all the complex underbody of an EV in one piece rather than about 400 parts in a conventional car the people said.EV calculatorHow much will I save if I choose an electric vehicle SELECT vehicle typeCalculate The know-how is core to Teslas  unboxed  manufacturing strategy unveiled by Chief Executive Musk in March a linchpin of his plan to churn out tens of millions of cheaper EVs in the coming decade and still make a profit the sources said . While Tesla has said its unboxed model involves producing large sub-assemblies of a car at the same time and then snapping them together the size and make-up of the modular blocks is still the subject of speculation . Terry Woychowski president of U.S. engineering company Caresoft Global said if Tesla managed to gigacast most of the underbody of an EV it would further disrupt the way cars are designed and manufactured .  It is an enabler on steroids . It has a huge implication for the industry but its a very challenging task  said Woychowski who worked for U.S. automaker GM for more than three decades .  Castings are very hard to do especially the bigger and the more complicated .  Two of the sources said Teslas previously unreported new design and manufacturing techniques meant the company could develop a car from the ground up in 18 to 24 months while most rivals can currently take anywhere from three to four years . The five people said a single large frame combining the front and rear sections with the middle underbody where the battery is housed could be used in Teslas small EV which it aims to launch with a price tag of $ 25,000 by the middle of the decade . Tesla was expected to make a decision on whether to die cast the platform in one piece as soon as this month three of the sources said though even if they do press ahead the end product could change during the design validation process . Neither Tesla nor Musk responded to questions from Reuters for this story . 3D PRINTING AND SAND The eakthrough Tesla has made centres on the how the giant molds for such a large part are designed and tested for mass production and how casts can incorporate hollow subframes with internal ribs to cut weight and boost crashworthiness . In both cases the innovations developed by design and casting specialists in Britain Germany Japan and the United States involve 3D printing and industrial sand the five people said . All spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to the media . So far automakers have shied away from casting ever-bigger structures because of the  gigacast dilemma  creating molds to make parts of 1.5 metres squared or more boosts efficiency but is expensive and comes with myriad risks . Once a large metal test mold has been made machining tweaks during the design process could cost $ 100,000 a go or redoing the mold altogether might come to $ 1.5 million according to one casting specialist . Another said the whole design process for a large metal mold would typically cost about $ 4 million . That has been deemed prohibitive by automakers especially as a design might need half a dozen tweaks or more to achieve a perfect die from the perspective of noise and viation fit and finish ergonomics and crashworthiness the sources said . But Musks vision from the start was to find a way to cast the underbody in one piece despite the risks the sources said . To overcome the obstacles Tesla turned to firms that make test molds out of industrial sand with 3D printers . Using a digital design file printers known as binder jets deposit a liquid binding agent onto a thin layer of sand and gradually build a mold layer by layer that can die cast molten alloys . According to one source the cost of the design validation process with sand casting even with multiple versions is minimal just 3 of doing the same with a metal prototype . That means Tesla can tweak prototypes as many times as needed reprinting a new one in a matter of hours using machines from companies such as Desktop Metal and its unit ExOne . The design validation cycle using sand casting only takes to two to three months two of the sources said compared with anywhere from six months to a year for metal mold prototypes . TAILOR-MADE ALLOYS The subframes in a car underbody are typically hollow to save weight and improve crashworthiness . At the moment they are made by stamping and welding multiple parts together leaving a void in the middle . To cast subframes with hollows as part of one gigacasting Tesla plans to place solid sand cores printed by the binder jets within the overall mold . Once the part has been cast the sand is removed to leave the voids . But despite that greater flexibility achieved in both the design process and the complexity of the large frames there was still one more major hurdle to clear . The aluminium alloys used to produce the castings behaved differently in sand and metal molds and often failed to meet Teslas criteria for crashworthiness and other attributes . The casting specialists overcame that by formulating special alloys fine-tuning the molten alloy cooling process and also coming up with an after-production heat treatment three of the sources said . And once Tesla is happy with the prototype mold it can then invest in a final metal one for mass production . The sources said Teslas upcoming small car has given it a perfect opportunity to cast an EV platform in one piece mainly because its underbody is simpler The kind of small cars Tesla is developing one for personal use and the other a robotaxi do n't have a big  overhang  at the front and the back as there is not much of a hood or rear trunk .  Its like a boat in a way a battery tray with small wings attached to both ends . That would make sense to do in one piece  one person said . The sources said however that Tesla still had to make a call on what kind of gigapress to use if it decides to cast the underbody in one piece and that choice would also dictate how complex the car frame would be . To punch out such large body parts fast the people said Tesla would need new bigger gigapresses with massive clamping power of 16,000 tons or more which would come with a hefty price tag and might need larger factory buildings . Three of the five sources said one problem with presses using high clamping power however was that they can not house the 3D printed sand cores needed to make hollow subframes . The people said Tesla could solve these obstacles by using a different type of press into which molten alloy can be injected slowly a method that tends to produce higher quality castings and can accommodate the sand cores . But the process takes longer .  Tesla could still choose high-pressure for productivity or they could choose slow alloy injection for quality and versatility  one of the people said .  Its still a coin toss at this point . |Tesla|Automotive|EconomicTimes|Sep 14, 2023, 03:37 PM |Tesla has made a breakthrough in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing by using innovative techniques such as gigacasting and 3D printing.

In August, power generation surged to a record 162.7 billion kilowatt hours, with coal's share in power output rising to 66.7%, the highest in six years. The government has defended the use of coal, citing lower per capita emissions compared to richer nations and rising renewable energy output. Despite higher demand for coal, power plants in India have slashed imports by 24% to 17.85 million metric tons during the first four months of the fiscal year. This is due to a 10.7% increase in production by state-run Coal India. Lower imports have kept global thermal coal prices depressed. The higher power use in India is attributed to farmers using more electricity for irrigation, intermittency of renewables, and increased cooling demand. India's peak electricity demand reached a record 243.9 gigawatts on August 31, exceeding available capacity by 7.3 gigawatts. In August, electricity supply fell short of demand by 780 million units, marking the highest shortage since April 2022. The shortage is attributed to poor monsoon, high agricultural demand, and the fall of wind generation. Weather officials expect country-wide rainfall in September to provide some respite. Coal's share in India's power output rose to 74.2% in the eight months ending in August, compared to 72.9% in the same period last year. This is on track for a third consecutive annual increase. In contrast, the share of hydro power fell from 10.9% to 9.2%. Overall power generation has risen significantly, with renewable generation increasing by only 16 billion units compared to over 108 billion units increase in total power generation this year. India failed to achieve its target of installing 175 GW in renewable energy by 2022. The country now aims to boost non-fossil capacity, including solar, wind, nuclear, hydro, and bio-power, to 500 GW by 2030.

The focus on quality management, strategic sourcing, and cost management has led to improved margins and impressive EBIDTA margins.|Brookfield to invest Rs 1,500 crore more in Leela|Y|In an exclusive interview with ET Ankur Gupta managing partner and head of real estate for the APAC region at Brookfield Asset Management spoke about additional investments in The Leela Palaces Hotels Resorts business the companys 'record performance and 'robust margins and the expansion plans going forward . Edited excerpts Q How has BrookfieldC/s $ 558 million investment in Leela fared A When we invested in the Leela business our engagement with them lasted throughout 2018-19 . This was prior to the global pandemic Covid-19 . Institutional capital had n't yet entered the market . The hotel industry had its challenges with only a few instances of major global investors taking stakes in operating properties or large platforms . Moreover there were issues such as low Average Daily Rates ADRs . In several markets you had occasional supply shocks . Sometimes supply took longer and sometimes there were extended development cycles.The pre-pandemic hotel industry in India faced ongoing difficulties . Leela for instance grappled with debt issues and had undergone debt restructuring including an NCLT filing . Despite these challenges there existed significant potential when considering the macro perspective . Factors like urbanisation a growing middle class and the hotel industrys role as a proxy for infrastructure like returns on the back of a consumer story which is very difficult for people to underwrite . Our investment approach focuses on micro-level investment . While the macro factors such as GDP growth real GDP and inflation favored the hotel industry certain essential elements were lacking . Leela despite being a world-class and known for exceptional service and high-quality properties faced under-management and a complex capital structure . The solution lay in injecting substantial capital to stabilise the financial structure enabling liquidity for growth and implementing a professionally led management strategy . Fast forward to a quarter after our investment the outeak of Covid-19 occurred . Surprisingly the elements we had previously focused on C/ a stable capital structure and access to liquidity C/ worked in our favor . Despite reduced business activity our hotels played a critical role in vaccine distribution and offered accommodation to those affected by travel disruptions . We managed to retain most of our associates and even provided bonuses as per their contracts setting us apart in the industry . Remarkably we continued to expand our business during this challenging period including the addition of a new Leela palace in Jaipur . From having four palaces we now operate five . Our efforts to ing in professional management for turnaround paid off when the market rebounded with tourism and travel gradually resuming . This period also saw minimal supply growth over three years but demand levels had risen . Traditionally hotels experienced a distinct pattern of volatility . They would have four strong days followed by three slower days.This pattern depended on the type of establishment C/ be it a resort that saw high activity on weekends or city properties that thrived on weekdays and vice versa . However the pandemic introduced a shift in this volatility . Resorts which previously encountered weakened demand on Sundays due to checkouts now witness extended stays from guests who choose to prolong their visits . This shift has notably transformed the fundamental volatility of the global hospitality industry . As a result all types of hotels are benefiting from this changed pattern . This shift positively impacts properties like Leela which offer luxurious experiences and top-tier service . As guests extend their stays by even just one additional night the appeal of indulging in the extra comfort and experience that these premium hotels provide becomes more appealing than ever before.Q How has the Leela business grown in the last two years A So when we acquired the business it was eight properties . Today we are looking at 12 hotels plus one more on the anvil . So its been fantastic in terms of growth of the overall franchise . We 've added one more Leela Palace . Leela palaces is what separates the and from everything else . Now the business spans 3400 rooms . We have put a capital backed growth programme not just a and led growth . So we are differentiated from the rest of the crowd in the way that asset light is a good buzzword . We have an investment led growth programme for Leela . Q How much investment has gone into Leela A The initial deal that we made you know was around Rs 4,500 crores . We 've since then committed more than Rs 1500 crore . This is the largest ever foreign investment in the Indian hospitality sector . Its well known that Brookfield is one of the largest investors globally in the real estate space . Our India business is very large in real estate . We can easily commit more capital as required in large transactions and we have done so . We 're looking at adding more than 300 rooms in CBD and other districts in Mumbai itself . So we will be inging in the Leela Palace and to CBD Mumbai . We are also looking at managed residences as well in core business districts in Mumbai . Besides that we have signed up a transaction in Maldives . People always asked us when is Leela going global With our investment in Leela the company became global overnight . We have investments in 30 countries . Our investors are from various parts of the world from Asia to the Middle East to the US to Europe Australia etc . So all of our reports go to those investors so Leela truly became global under our ownership . For two years Leela was ranked globally number one by Travel and Leisure magazine as the best hotel and in the world . This year we are ranked number three as the best hotel and in the world . So Leela has truly become global . But as far as LeelaC/s hotel operations are concerned between now and over the next couple of years we will see Leela going into the Maldives . We are looking at some interesting situations in the Middle East and London.As the Indian diaspora gains prominence on the global stage authentic Indian ands like Leela have a promising trajectory . Q How has the business done in terms of topline and bottomline A In the current year we are poised to achieve a remarkable milestone the best performance in the last three decades coupled with strong profit margins . In the hospitality industry achieving robust margins is a significant achievement and this success can be attributed to the alignment of incentives between the business owner and the management which is very much the case with Leela . At Leela our objectives are twofold to increase both revenue and margins . Regarding our top-line performance we are poised to achieve significant revenue this year reaching the four-digit mark . And most of it is from our own hotels . With the quality and appeal of our properties theres every reason to expect that our hotels can surpass this double-digit growth rate on a year-over-year basis . This trajectory aligns with the oader economic context of Indias growth story making it entirely plausible for properties of Leelas caliber to consistently outpace this robust growth rate.Leelas continued success in delivering strong returns is indeed promising . In terms of margins its noteworthy that the service levels across all Leela properties have not only been restored to pre-Covid levels but have actually surpassed them . We have introduced innovative programmes and experiences that resonate with guests . We did not have any reduction in staff numbers due to the pandemic.Margins in the hospitality industry are driven by a combination of factors including effective management practices efficient sourcing and procurement and initiatives to reduce energy and operating costs . These efforts contribute to operating leverage ultimately leading to improved margins . Brookfield is one of the largest investors in the global hospitality industry and that depth of knowledge and insights contribute to Leelas success . With a focus on quality management strategic sourcing and prudent cost management Leela is well positioned to continue its growth trajectory while maintaining impressive margins . EBIDTA margins are higher than ever in history of Leela . Q Are you looking at saturating the metros with new properties a strategy that many competitors have followed A Leelas and essence revolves around a carefully crafted investment-led growth programme that ensures its properties stand out in the market . The distinction between Leelas individual properties like Leela Palace Chanakyapuri in New Delhi and other hotel ands is vital considering the unique characteristics of each establishment . Comparing a hotel like Leela Palace Chanakyapuri with its unparalleled location superior build quality exceptional service spacious rooms and remarkable dining experiences to a larger chain of hotels would n't be a fair comparison due to the varying nature of these businesses.However Leelas focus remains consistent across every market it operates in or plans to enter with a robust pipeline of projects . In Mumbai we already have two hotels on the anvil . In Delhi-NCR we have The Leela Palace Chanakyapuri and two Leela hotels in Gurgaon and East Delhi . In Bangalore a new hotel was recently commissioned in the Bhartiya City Complex in North Bangalore alongside Leela Palace Bengaluru . Wherever we are present we are consolidating our position . In Rajasthan we had one hotel Leela Palace Udaipur then we opened a Leela Palace Jaipur . We recently had two management contracts signed in Kerala . Its a very deliberate growth by keeping and standards very high . Q Right now you have 12 operational hotels . What kind of pipeline are you looking at A We are looking at around 1000 rooms in a couple of years . We are looking at more resorts . We are on the verge of operationalizing a property in the Northeast of India . We 're actively exploring opportunities in Jammu and Kashmir as well as within the tourism circuit of Uttar Pradesh . All these new properties will contribute to the expansion of the Leela and . By establishing a well-connected network we are creating a strong foundation for subsequent growth to naturally follow.Currently our emphasis is on refining input metrics recognizing that the right actions lead to desired outcomes . Its integral for our hotels whether owned or managed to consistently generate satisfactory returns on capital . This principle holds true enabling smoother development for our next properties . Q You have prime assets across India . Are you also looking at leveraging those A We are currently designing a mixed use property in CBD Mumbai a combination of office and a Leela palace . We 're looking at similar concepts in Bangalore right now where hotels will be created in CBD districts . Mixed use is the way to go for commercial real estate . It works very well for the end user being able to walk to work from your hotel room . ItC/s not just luxury its something that creates value for our capital because of the right user experience . We are known in the world by these market leading districts that we establish . If you look at our entire portfolio right now itC/s around these large urban mixed use clusters where there is an element of shopping there is an element of office . Of course hospitality will be a critical element as well.Q So all different parts of your businesses are coming together and that will be a different kind of a leverage A We are quite fortunate in Brookfield that we are not a single asset investor . In a business such as ours and you add the emerging markets volatility patience is something that is required . So you have to be patient in not doing a deal too soon . And most importantly after you have invested there will be ups and downs . We talked about the Covid 19 pandemic hitting the Leela business in the first quarter of our investment . But if you fundamentally believe that the building blocks of your business are strong it will come back.Q One of the ways the hospitality companies are growing in India is basically getting into new categories . Do you have a play there A Our business in India has a very large real asset component where we can play in multiple categories as Brookfield Asset Management . If I wear my Brookfield hat we can invest in any type of hospitality play . We can invest in select service we can invest in mid scale we can invest in upper upscale besides luxury . We can invest in resorts we can invest in city hotels services and we are evaluating all of these concepts on a regular basis . As far as the Leela business is concerned its a real play on luxury and that will remain the core of that business . Brookfield is fortunate that we are involved in the business today . It is a celeation of Indian culture . We have $ 25 billion worth of capital invested in the country . Our business would n't be complete if we did n't have something like this in the portfolio which is truly Indian but run by global standards.Q Globally you have a lot of focus on ESG . So will that also translate into the India business A ESG is core to our DNA . We are the largest investors in renewable power assets in the world . Most of our buildings today in India and across the world are green certified . We have a massive programme going on in India and across the world on powering our properties through renewable power . In India we have taken a pledge to be net zero by 2040 . So ESG is core to our business and it requires capital investment . And we are prepared to do that because today there is a return on that capital . Over 35 of the Leela portfolio is powered by renewable sources of energy which were commissioned by us . And you have to make significant diverse efforts to do it . Its not just power but recycling food making sure your energy consumption is lower making sure your equipment is modern . A lot of things go into ESG management.Q Are you also looking at the Leela investment from an exit point of view What is the timeframe A As we discussed we are patient to get into a business and then run it patiently as well . As I look at any business that we have today in the country or anywhere else we run businesses for fundamentals that are required for the businesses a recapitalization or a public market event is just a natural course on the capital side of the business . The fundamental operations of business are about making your hotels better more ESG compliant growing the business entering into new sectors such as resorts wildlife or global expansion . So we run a business for perpetuity . Thats the way I see it.Q But there would be a timeframe.A We own this business for three and a half years right now out of which more than two years were impacted by Covid . So I would say we 're just getting started.Q How has the business been in the first six months of this year A Since the global markets opened up India did a fantastic job in managing the pandemic . As I said this year we are on track to have the best year ever in terms of revenue . Margins are solid . Our new hotels are doing very well . Our existing hotels have had record room rates.Q WhatC/s the outlook for the festive year end quarter A Besides the festivals thereC/s G20 and we are talking about the World Cup coming in . Across the country you see the palpable vibe . So people are looking forward to the next three four months . So we are very excited about it.Q WhatC/s your take on the government policies around the sector Can the government do more A There are too many questions asked to the government . I think the government is doing a fantastic job . We should also ask ourselves what are we doing We are very excited about the divestment programmes coming up in various states . Some of our economic growth initiatives will be around the government divestment programmes . Wildlife could be a very interesting segment where lots of government initiatives are required to really promote wildlife . Divestments are talked about in Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir and there are some great properties . We are one of the few ands that are in the business of investing our own capital so we are truly unique in that perspective . We now have high speed rail connectivity and improving access to what used to be the remote areas in India . India is modernizing existing airports besides adding several new airports . So the government is playing its part . ItC/s up to us to do our bit now .|Brookfield Asset Management|Real Estate|EconomicTimes|Sep 08, 2023, 07:25 PM |Brookfield Asset Management's investment of $558 million in The Leela Palaces Hotels Resorts business has helped stabilize its financial structure and enable liquidity for growth.

Jio highlighted the recent decision by the New Zealand government to allow dual use of spectrum. The suggestion for flexible use is based on the latest changes in technology and standards that enable the creation of integrated and converged networks. The New Zealand government has agreed to allocate the 24.25-27.5 GHz band primarily for mobile use, with the option to include some satellite services in certain areas. The 27.5-28.35 GHz range will be shared for mobile and satellite services, while the 28.35-29.5 GHz band will be allocated for satellite services, with the option to include some mobile use. This decision demonstrates the recognition of the need for flexible use of spectrum in the wake of technological convergence in telecommunication networks. Jio highlights that the 3GPP specifications in release-17 have enabled the convergence of satellite and terrestrial networks. Several countries have been considering the assignment of spectrum for flexible use between these networks. Jio urges the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to ensure the optimum and evolving technology-centric assignment of spectrum, as it is a finite and scarce resource for wireless broadband connectivity. Satcom firms like OneWeb and Amazon, backed by the Bharti Group, are advocating for administrative allocation of spectrum. On the other hand, telecom operators Jio and Vodafone Idea are in favor of spectrum allocation to the highest bidder, similar to the case of telcos. This highlights the ongoing debate regarding the allocation of spectrum for satellite communication services.|Allow flexible spectrum use between Satcom Telecom Jio|Y|Reliance Jio has sought flexible use of spectrum between satellite and terrestrial networks from the telecom regulator particularly in the Ku and Ka bands and highlighted a recent decision taken by New Zealand government allowing such dual use.In its letter to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Trai on September 5 Jio stressed the suggestion for flexible use of spectrum is based upon the latest changes in technology and standards that allowed the creation of integrated and converged networks.A copy of the letter was also marked to Apurva Chandra who was having additional charge of Telecom Secretary DoT Member Technology Gunjan Dave Trai secretary V Raghunandan and DoT wireless advisor VJ Christopher.As per Trais consultation paper on assignment of spectrum for space-based communication services Ku band ranges from 10 GHz to 15 GHz while Ka band ranges from 17 GHz to 31 GHz.Jio said the New Zealand government has agreed to allocate 24.25-27.5 GHz primarily for mobile use with an option to include some satellite services in some areas . Bands in the 27.5-28.35 GHz range are to be shared for mobile and satellite services while 28.35-29.5 GHz to be allocated for satellite services with the option to include some mobile use .  The above decisions shows that New Zealand government has recognised the need for flexible use of spectrum in the wake of imminent technological convergence in telecommunication networks under integrated and converged satellite and terrestrial networks  Jio said in the letter to Trai chairman PD Vaghela . As per Trai Ku band can be used for both fixed satellite services and mobile satellite services . The band is also commonly used for DTH television oadcasting and satellite internet services.The Ka band is commonly used for high-speed oadband and fixed and mobile satellite services . In India currently some quantum in the millimetre wave mmWave band which is part of the Ka band has been auctioned for 5G mobility use . Also some airwaves in the Ku band are being used by telecom operators for backhaul purposes.Jio wants flexible use for whatever quantum of bandwidth is reserved for satellite services in the Ka and Ku bands .  We reiterate that the 3GPP specifications in its release-17 have already enabled the convergence of satellite and terrestrial networks . Therefore several countries have been considering the assignment of spectrum for flexible use between terrestrial and satellite networks  Jio said .  As you are aware spectrum is a finite and scarce resource and is irreplaceable for the provision of wireless oadband connectivity ... therefore the Authority should ensure the optimum and evolving technology centric assignment of spectrum  Jio added.Satcom firms such as Bharti Group-backed OneWeb and Amazon are pitching for administrative allocation of spectrum .

The band is also commonly used for direct-to-home DTH television oadcasting and satellite internet services.Furthermore the Ka band is commonly used for high-speed oadband and fixed and mobile satellite services . In India currently some quantum in the millimeter wave band which is part of the Ka band has been auctioned for 5G mobility use .

Jio argues that with technological advancements, the distinction between the two has vanished. The move comes ahead of an expected consultation paper by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on the mode of allocating such airwaves. Jio has requested the DoT to send a fresh reference to Trai, stating that E-band spectrum can also be used for mobile services. Jio believes that the use of integrated access backhaul (IAB) E-band spectrum can provide high-speed broadband in densely populated areas where laying fiber is difficult and uneconomical. While Jio has not explicitly asked for auctioning E-band spectrum, it has requested the DoT to clarify that E-band spectrum can be used for mobile services. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has changed its stance on the allocation mechanism for spectrum after a 2012 Supreme Court order backed auction as the mode of allocation for scarce natural resources like airwaves. DoT was considering auction as a mode to allocate E and V bands as well as backhaul carriers, a move opposed by technology companies. Trai is expected to come out with a consultation paper on the mechanism for allocating E and V bands spectrum and backhaul carriers to telecom operators.|Reliance Jio seeks DoT nod to widen E-band spectrum use|Y|Reliance Jio has applied to the Department of Telecommunications DoT seeking approval to widen the use of E-band spectrum to access or mobility use in addition to backhaul stressing that with technological advancement the distinction between the two has vanished.The DoT had last year given E-band spectrum to telcos administratively for backhaul use only to smoothen 5G roll out . The telecom market leaders move seeking mobile use for E-band 71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz comes ahead of an expected consultation paper by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Trai on the mode of allocating such airwaves . Jio now wants the DoT to send a fresh reference to Trai which underlines that E-band spectrum can also be used for access services.Jio has told DoT that its requirement to use E-band for access services in addition to backhaul is fully aligned with technological developments and international standards of 3GPP . With the use of integrated access backhaul IAB E-band spectrum can be used in providing high speed oadband in densely populated areas where laying of last mile fie is difficult and uneconomical  Jio is believed to have told DoT.A query sent to Jio regarding the E-band use remained unanswered at the time of going to press.Backhaul has to do with connecting the core of a mobile network to nodes and then onto towers to transmit data elements that are critical for an effective 5G mobile oadband operation . So in places where a telco cant lay fiewhich requires manpower for laying and maintaining national and local level permissions besides a lot of investmentE band spectrum can be used as a substitute which is also more cost-efficient than fie.While Jio has not explicitly asked for auctioning E-band spectrum it has requested DoT to send the fresh reference to Trai stating that E-band spectrum can be used for mobile services also.Earlier DoT had asked Trai to furnish recommendations for allocating E and V bands as well as backhaul carriers with a specific purpose of providing backhaul connectivity only.Traditionally backhaul spectrum used to be given administratively to telecom operators . But DoT was considering auction as a mode to allocate E and V bands as well as backhaul carriers a move opposed by technology companies.DoTs stance changed regarding allocation mechanism for spectrum after the 2012 Supreme Court order which backed auction as the mode of allocation of all scarce natural resources like airwaves.Lately technology firms have stopped staking claim on E-band spectrum while insisting that V band or at least a part of it should be delicensed for wifi use.As reported by ET Trai will soon come out with a consultation paper to deliberate on the mechanism for allocating E and V bands spectrum and backhaul carriers to telecom operators.Trai is likely to treat E and V bands separately as they have slightly different characteristics . While E band can now be used for mobility services the usage of V band spectrum 57-64 GHz and 64-71 GHz has not become prevalent so far . DoT has suggested to Trai that a certain quantum in the V band may be delicensed or allotted without auctions for indoor coverage.Though Trai had in 2014 recommended a light-touch licensing regime and no auction for the bands the DoT now feels that the situation has changed over the past six-seven years .|Reliance Jio|Telecommunications|EconomicTimes|Sep 13, 2023, 09:57 AM |Reliance Jio has applied to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to expand the use of E-band spectrum for mobile services, in addition to backhaul.

This arrest marks a significant downfall for Goyal, who was once a prominent figure in India's aviation industry. The arrest comes after a criminal complaint against Goyal by Canara Bank. One of the mistakes made by Naresh Goyal was the acquisition of rival airline Air Sahara in 2007. This deal caused numerous financial, legal, and human resource-related problems for Jet Airways. The acquisition reduced Jet's ability to compete effectively with other airlines and wasted IPO funds that could have been used for other purposes. Another mistake made by Naresh Goyal was the decision to buy a mixed fleet of wide-bodied Airbus A330 and Boeing 777 planes. This impractical decision increased the cost of resources and resulted in a lower seating capacity compared to the global standard. Goyal's insistence on retaining first-class seats that were not earning anything further added to the airline's financial troubles.|How Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal built a successful airline and then sank it|Y|The arrest of Naresh Goyal the founder of Jet Airways by the Enforcement Directorate on Friday evening in an alleged money-laundering case points at a sheer downfall of a man who once soared high in Indias aviation industry . Earlier in Feuary the Bombay High Court had quashed an Enforcement DirectorateC/s money-laundering case against Goyal and his wife Anita . However the court had observed that if any fresh case was registered against the couple by any law enforcement agency the ED could probe them . The current ED probe comes after a criminal complaint against Goyal by Canara Bank . From modest beginnings sleeping in his uncles travel agency in Delhi where he worked during the day Goyal weaved through the thicket of Indian bureaucracy to build the countrys biggest domestic airline the Guardian had written about him in 2006 when he was at his peak of success . Goyals humble beginningsGoyal rose from the ground working his way up from a travel agency to founding an airline that was counted among the best . Born at Sangrur a small town in Punjab he studied commerve at a college in Pataila . He began his entrepreneurial journey as a cashier at his uncle Charandas RamlalC/s travel company East-West Agencies . He grew to become an independent general sales agent GSA building connections with airline executives across the world . GSAs in the 1990s were powerful . They worked as international airlinesC/ representatives in the local market and were several notches higher in the pecking order than travel agents . At its peak Jet Air TransportC/s office was aligned with 17 desks each representing a different global airline according to an ET story . Always a sharp networker Goyal once took a visiting official from lobbying body International Air Transport Association IATA to Agra and bought him and his team marble-topped furniture worth Rs 5 lakh ET had reported . Then over lunch and subsequent cups of tea he had a three-hour discussion on buying some smaller aircraft . This was a strategy meeting minus corporate frills.Jet Airways started as an air taxi service operator in 1993 and went on to become IndiaC/s biggest airline offering top-class international services . It started with a 20 equity partnership with Kuwait Airways and Gulf Air both of whom exited later . Its overseas operations kicked off with a Chennai-Colombo route in 2004 . Its successful initial public offer IPO was in 2005 . Nothing was going wrong . But then something big did.Two mistakes that Goyal madeMany observers argue that JetC/s financial problems started with Goyal buying out rival Air Sahara in 2007 for Rs 1,450 crore an ET story had narrated when Jet shut down its operations in April 2019 . This was a deal that gave Jet endless problems C/ financial legal and human resource-related . Goyal bought Sahara to take on Kingfisher Airlines and low-fare carriers Air Deccan IndiGo and SpiceJet . But the deal reduced JetC/s ability to spend extra money to take on the competition effectively . Jet wasted IPO funds that remained after placing plane orders.C/After that the smallest of bumps affected Jet more than its peers . Over the years it has depended more and more on external positive factors such as fares going up and fuel prices coming down C/ an industry executive had told ET.Kingfisher shut down operations in 2012 . IndiGo quietly grew to topple Jet from its leadership position . Then came the second big mistake . Goyal decided to buy a mixed fleet of 10 wide-bodied Airbus A330 and Boeing 777 planes . Mixing in such a small fleet was impractical as it increased the cost of resources . Also Goyal decided to configure them C/like palaces C/ building in only 308 seats much lower than the global standard of about 400 . He lost a fourth of the potential revenue in the process executives had told ET.Even when the configuration changed to 348 seats Goyal insisted on retaining eight first class seats long after it was proven that they were not earning anything . He didnC/t listen to advice from his then commerce chief Sudheer Raghavan and longtime associate CEO Nikos Kardassis . At 250 kg each the seats added an unnecessary 8 tonne to aircraft weight that earned nothing for the flight . WhatC/s more there was never a proper network planned for the aircraft.Since 2008 Jet had to lease out up to 70 of its wide-bodies to the likes of Turkish Airlines Oman Air Thai Airways Gulf Air and Etihad . C/Jet wasnC/t a leasing company but was forced to behave like one C/ an executive had told ET . C/At least two executives from the top management used to travel for weeks every month in search of airlines that would take the aircraft on lease . It took up to six months to find an interested lessee . This when fuel prices were rising competition was getting utal and the management should have focused on running the airline.C/The beginning of the downfallJet faced its first serious financial distress in 2011-12 . Goyal responded by pretty much single-handedly leading negotiations with Etihad run by hard-nosed Australian James Hogan . Close to 50 meetings later Goyal managed to sell Etihad 24 for $ 379 million a near-impossible price given the precarious state Jet was in . But the miracle came at a price C/ Goyal soon saw his beloved company slipping out of his hands the ET story had narrated.C/EtihadC/s entry was the first instance that filled him with fear of losing control C/ an executive had told ET . The Gulf carrier came in with 15 men and an aim to C/professionaliseC/ Jet though also to make a feeder airline of it . Weekly meetings with department heads were organised routes changed anding overhauled and cost discrepancies flagged.But Goyal soon took back charge . The Etihad men left . Almost as a retaliatory move Jet shifted its global hub to Amsterdam from Brussels and in November 2017 signed deep commercial agreements with the Air France-KLM combine . This was an opportunity Goyal had squandered in 2010 by wooing Star Alliance a global airline group that chose Air India as its member instead . Again Goyal stitched together the new agreement almost single-handedly with trusted lieutenant Gaurang Shetty . That was perhaps his last big win for Jet the ultimate proof of his superlative networking skills.Meanwhile the fear of losing control had taken deep root . C/In many meetings last year when he took the top management to task for the airline losing money he often ended the tirades with C/What should I do Dilute stake in the airline that I have built Exit C/C/ recalled a former executive who was present at many of those meetings.Mistakes piled up as Goyal started to run the airline again . In 2013-14 Jet had the opportunity to offload all the costly A330-200s to several potential buyers including Turkish Airlines . But Goyal bargained over the price and lost the deal . Again in 2016 Jet had the opportunity to sell its entire ATR fleet which was incurring an annual loss of over $ 100 million to Etihad Regional or Air Serbia . And again Goyal baulked . These lost opportunities returned to haunt Jet . Over the last 12 months it has searched for and failed to find buyers for its Airbus A330s and ATRs . The nosediveIn the first signs of big trouble Jet posted Q4FY18 loss of Rs 1,036 crore as against a net profit of Rs 602 crore in the same period a year earlier . This was the companyC/s first quarterly loss in 11 quarters . Jets net worth had turned negative . In August KPMG India affiliate BSR Co refused to sign on the first quarter results of Jet . The audit firm raised doubts over the airlineC/s ability to continue operations.The crisis had started in March 2018 with delayed salary payments for employees and a 25 pay cut for top management . It escalated sharply between January and March 2019 with the airline grounding more than 100 planes . On multiple occasions potential investors Etihad and TPG threatened to walk out if Goyal remained at the airline . Tatas had carried out talks with Goyal for a possible investment . But talks with Tatas as well as another potential investor Delta Airlines stalled over GoyalC/s future role . Prospective investors wanted Goyal to cede control . His departure was seen as a key element of any revival strategy having been unable to prevent the airlineC/s slide . In March 2019 lender SBI asked Goyal and three fellow directors to resign in view of the airline edging closer to the ink after more and more planes began getting grounded every week for lack of funds . Lenders took over the companyC/s management and board . Lenders came to own slightly more than half of Jet while GoyalC/s shareholding had reduced to half of his earlier holding of 50.1 On a night in April 2019 Jet decided to suspend all flights as cash ran out and banks refused to give more money . The move came after JetC/s last-ditch attempt to raise emergency loans failed . The airline had approached banks with an appeal for Rs 983 crore . The banks refused to release any funds without additional collateral . Jet had defaulted on loans as well as vendor and lessor payments . It had been forced to ground planes since the beginning of the year primarily due to defaults to leasing companies . And it hadnC/t paid its employees since January.Goyal who was out of Jet but was still getting clingy flummoxed lenders when from London he again bid for his airline after the lenders put it under the auctioneerC/s hammer . His offer was rejected . In between he continued to bicker with the lenders saying they werenC/t doing a proper job of reviving Jet . C/Goyal has failed his company his employees and his shareholders C/ a top airline executive had told ET at that time . C/He had a readymade investment opportunity from Tata Sons which he squandered . Jet was sailing till January . Then it all went downhill.C/JetC/s fall is a story of the fall of its founder an ET story had said . Few business failures are so inseparable from the failings of their promoters .|Jet Airways|Transportation|EconomicTimes|Sep 03, 2023, 12:30 AM |Naresh Goyal, the founder of Jet Airways, has been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in an alleged money-laundering case, marking a significant downfall for the once-prominent figure in India's aviation industry.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59170185|Transition to Remote Work; Rise of Digital Advertising; Third-Party Verification in Digital Advertising|Lisa Utzschneider, CEO of Integral Ad Science (IAS), explains how her 700-person workforce transitioned to remote work during the pandemic. The company implemented a hat-wearing custom to foster team spirit and unity among employees working from home. This transition presented challenges for Utzschneider, including pivoting company culture, floating the company on the stock exchange, and balancing work and parenting responsibilities. IAS, a company that specializes in verifying genuine audience engagement and reputation management in online advertising, works with major brands like Nestle and Coca Cola. With the shift in marketing budgets towards social media content, there has been a significant increase in spending on digital advertising. IAS ensures that video advertisements on social media platforms are effectively targeted and do not appear next to inappropriate or controversial content. Digital platforms like YouTube have recognized the need for third-party verification to build trust with advertisers. IAS acts as a neutral observer, inspecting the services offered by social media platforms to ensure transparency and brand safety. Advertisers, who invest significant amounts of money on these platforms, rely on third-party verification to ensure a return on their investment.|CEO Secrets 'Wearing caps on video calls keeps us unified|Y|"This video can not be playedWATCH Lisa Utzschneider explains her caps on calls policyHow do you foster team spirit when your 700-person workforce is suddenly working from home One tech firm boss explains her tactics for our business advice series CEO Secrets.Lisa Utzschneider is n't wearing her baseball cap during our interview by video call but for internal company meetings at the moment it would be expected .  Wearing our hats together as a global organisation unifies our team  she says.Her employees usually based in offices dotted around the world have been working from home during the past 18 months of the pandemic . As hyid working becomes the norm this will remain the status quo for the majority for a while although the New York and London offices are now open.The caps are a way of  showing up  for work and proving you know everyone is in it together she says.The pandemic has been a busy time for Ms Utzschneider who became CEO of Integral Ad Science IAS in early 2019 . The new job came with many challenges . She swiftly had to pivot company culture to suit lockdown conditions float the company on the stock exchange and deal with the challenges of being a parent of young children all while working from home herself . IAS is the kind of company that has popped up in the past decade to serve a new digital need verification of genuine audience engagement and reputation management in online advertising . Marketing budgets are increasingly spent on social media content rather than television and print . There has been a sharp rise in the past decade in the amount of money ands spend directly on online influencers for instance to spread their message . Globally businesses have spent more money on digital advertising than traditional formats since 2019 according to eMarketer . Economies like the US and UK reached this tipping point several years earlier.IAS works with some of the biggest ands in the world like Nestle and Coca Cola . It makes sure their video adverts on social media platforms are being targeted effectively and in a way that does n't create a bad impression of the and like rolling next to violent highly politicised or sexually charged material .  If you think of a Nestle advert running on YouTube  explains Ms Utzschneider  we verify that their video ad was viewed by a human and not a bot and also that it ran next to safe and suitable content .  The companys software algorithms gather and analyse vast amounts of data every day to do this.These huge companies do n't want the social media platforms to be  grading their own homework  says Ms Utzschneider explaining that a third party is needed to build trust . Advertisers spend hundreds of millions of dollars on these platforms so need to get a return on their investment she says.At first the social media platforms did not necessarily like this arrangement but that response has changed she says.YouTube  did a complete 180  in the Spring of 2019 she remembers when it came under pressure from marketers about inappropriate and violent content appearing next to their adverts.Since then the digital platforms have realised they need to become more transparent and allow a third party to inspect the service they are offering she explains . Ms Utzschneider likens her company to Switzerland during the Second World War a neutral observer in the online battle for peoples attention not directly involved in the fray.Ms Utzschneiders route to the top has been a progressive steady one with roles at some of techs biggest behemoths along the way.In her mid-twenties in the early 2000s she was working in the non-profit public policy sector but decided to make the switch to the booming world of commercial technology . She left a senior role with the International Relief Committee to work for Microsoft . But the transition was not straightforward . She was rejected after the first round of interviews something that still pains her .  I rang the recruiters the next day to politely ask why they rejected me  she remembers  they said that I did n't display enough passion . So I said 'give me another interview and I bet I can show you passion .  The tactic worked and she landed a different entry level role as an account manager at MSN Microsofts digital advertising division.After a decade at Microsoft she took a job with Amazon where she became global vice president of advertising sales a chance to build a global advertising business . Marissa Meyer then persuaded her to join Yahoo to build an advertising business . All these jobs involved gruelling hours but also the challenge of being a woman leader in the world of predominantly male senior tech leaders .  I 've been on hundreds if not thousands of conference calls where I 'm the only female dialling-in . I learned early the importance of finding your voice showing up prepared speaking up early and often  she says .  I 've also developed a very strong muscle ofC/| when others interrupt me just politely calling them out . Or calling that peer afterwards on the phone to say 'Hey in the future can you give me some room in the meeting so that I can share and contribute It made me very resilient .  As a direct result of this experience she made it a  strategic priority  and a  personal commitment  to build a female-majority board when she became CEO of IAS.But back to those hats.The transition to home working has been the defining challenge for many businesses during the pandemic however in some ways it made the IPO easier says Utzschneider . She could do the roadshow of investor presentations online by video call from home rather than the usual gruelling method of touring the country living out of a suitcase . She could have dinner with her kids every evening.But the downside to working from home was potentially a disconnected company culture . So the hat-wearing custom became a visual statement that they did n't want to let that disconnect happen . Shes worn her hat for town hall meetings on-boarding sessions for new employees analyst calls and investor meetings .  Our hats-on mantra has unified the organisation  says Utzschneider.But what she had n't expected is that the hats also help with family life .  When my two young girls see I have the hat on they know mums at work and that means they ca n't really come in and visit me but when I come downstairs for a meal they 'll tell me 'Mom its time to take your hat off 'People have become more upfront and open about talking to their colleagues about their personal priorities which can have a profound effect on simple things like time management says Utzschneider.For example working parents ca n't always stay for  just another five minutes  at the end of the meeting and should n't have to accept a two-night work trip when a one-night one is possible allowing them to put their kids to bed an extra night.These conversations are happening more and more at work now she finds .  Its a more transparent way of working that lets us support each other and spend that quality time with our loved ones .

The exact amount has not been disclosed as both companies are privately held. Fanbytes connects social media influencers with big brands for promotion work and has worked with popular influencers on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Black entrepreneurs, like Timothy Armoo, face significant challenges in accessing funding for their start-ups. A recent report by Extend Ventures revealed that less than one percent of venture capital investment in the UK went to black entrepreneurs between 2009 and 2019. Additionally, black-owned businesses are four times more likely to have their loan applications rejected compared to white or South Asian business founders. Timothy Armoo's success as an entrepreneur is notable considering his upbringing on a council estate in south London and limited financial resources. He attributes some of his success to a fortunate opportunity when he won a scholarship to an independent school, which exposed him to a different world and gave him confidence. Armoo used his experiences and skills to build Fanbytes and connect with investors.|I was a poor kid but it put steely determination in me|Y|As a young black entrepreneur with few industry contacts Timothy Armoo 27 has more than beaten the odds to raise investment scale and then sell his start-up . He grew up on a council estate in south London and puts some of his success down to a  lucky eak  as a teenager .  When I talk to my girlfriend about it  says Mr Armoo  she goes 'you know that you 're not meant to be able do this  Mr Armoo founded his social media advertising business Fanbytes in 2017 building it up to employ 65 people . The London company connects social media influencers with big ands for promotion work . He has just sold the business to a larger advertising firm called Brainlabs for an eight-figure sum he says both companies are in private hands so the exact sum has not been disclosed.It is still incredibly difficult for black entrepreneurs to access funding for start-ups.Less than one per cent of venture capital investment in the UK went to black entrepreneurs between 2009 and 2019 according to a recent report by Extend Ventures a similar figure to the United States . And recent government statistics suggest black-owned businesses are four times more likely to have their business loan applications rejected than white or South Asian business founders.Mr Armoo was born in Hackney in London but moved to Ghana to live with his grandmother when he was 3 months old remaining there for ten years.Returning to London in his early teens he lived in Mawby House council estate on the Old Kent Road in a flat with his father a first generation immigrant .  I was a poor kid we never had a lot of money and it put some steely determination in me  says Mr Armoo.But then he got what he calls  a lucky eak  when he won a sixth-form scholarship to independent school Christs Hospital in London where boarding fees are more than PS12,000 per term .  It introduced me to a world I had n't known before  he says .  There was a kid who one day got picked up by helicopter . It opened up my eyes and gave me a sense of confidence for what is possible even though there were n't that many people who looked like me there.He says the experience gave him confidence  in how to talk in certain circles the subjects you engage in  he then used those skills building Fanbytes for meeting investors among other things.This video can not be playedArmoo explains how business mindset is built on maths CEO Secrets 2019Mr Armoo has also capitalised on the growing value of social media influencers in advertising.Fanbytes signs up social media stars on TikTok Instagram and Snapchat getting them to work with big ands to collaborate on their advertising campaigns . Mr Armoo created Fanbytes with two other black entrepreneurs and close friends Amose Cooke and Mitchell Fasanya . Mr Cooke developed the companys proprietary algorithm as part of his university dissertation at Imperial College London . It scrapes data to search for up-and-coming social media influencers meaning Fanbytes can sign them up before they get popular and expensive.These days it works with some of TikToks biggest stars like Rhia from the UK who is a toy influencer with more than 14m followers and vlogger Bella Poarch who has 89m followers . Clients have included everyone from Deliveroo to the UK government . Fanbytes has been bought up by Brainlabs a digital advertising company set up in 2012 by former Google employee Daniel Gilbert .  Influencer marketing has rapidly become an integral part of the digital media mix and influencers have become the new A-listers  says Mr Gilbert  so to be able to offer it alongside our other capabilities under one roof is a huge advantage to our clients .  TikToks advertising revenue is likely to triple to $ 11bn in 2022 more than the combined ad revenues of Twitter and Snapchat according to research firm Insider Intelligence .  Influencer advertising is growing in importance to ands as people spend increasing amounts of time looking at content from social media personalities  says Rebecca McGrath Mintels associate director for Media and Technology.Nearly one in five 19 people who viewed influencer content bought a product or service after seeing an influencer promote it on social media in the three months to November 2021 according to a recent Mintel report.This means advertising firms that still focus on traditional advertising like print in the future might start buying smaller start-ups dedicated specifically to influencers says Ms McGrath.Mr Armoo hopes that he can inspire others to follow in his footsteps.One of the biggest hindrances for black founders says Mr Armoo  is that they do n't see other people like them doing it which would normalise success . The funding is there and the opportunities are there .  Mr Armoo has been sharing his business advice on his social media accounts .  I 've always seen myself as an entrepreneur first then a black entrepreneur  he says .  Otherwise you start to put too much emphasis on your race and you start to think about all the statistics around lower funding rates or lack of exits which results in you mentally playing on the back foot .  Be objective and solve problems . Focus on being so good they ca n't ignore you .

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63075729|Telecoms fraud in Taiwan; Scammers targeting Taiwanese people overseas; Challenges in fighting telecoms fraud|Taiwan is a hotbed for telecoms fraud due to its small population and technical expertise in high-tech technology. Organized criminals, both Taiwanese gangs and those from mainland China and elsewhere, use Taiwan as a practice ground for new phone scams before expanding them across Asia and globally. The coronavirus pandemic and the high stock market in Taiwan have led to a surge in investment scams. Taiwanese criminal networks have opened up operations overseas, with cases of Taiwanese people being lured to countries like Cambodia under false promises of high wages and forced to work as telephone fraudsters. These criminal networks are extensive and have global reach, highlighting the need for international cooperation in combating telecoms fraud. There is a constant battle between anti-fraud firms and fraudsters, with scammers finding ways to bypass spam-blocking apps like Whoscall. Burst dialing is a common method used by fraudsters to find active phone numbers, and once a potential victim is identified, scammers employ various tactics such as offering loans or investment advice to deceive them. While AI software can help detect and intervene in scams, digital literacy and education are also crucial in preventing people from falling into traps.|Taiwans front-line battle against mobile phone fraud|Y|"Telecoms security boss Jeff Kuo says that fighting mobile phone fraud is a constant battle and that Taiwan is on the front line .  This is like a miniature of the world here in Taiwan where we see all kinds of fraud in advance  says Mr Kuo .  We can use this knowledge to protect other countries because we can see what is going to happen first .  Mr Kuo is boss of Taiwanese firm Gogolook which owns Whoscall one of the most popular spam blocking apps on the island and across East Asia in general . It says its artificial intelligence powered software constantly trawls more than 1.6 billion telephone numbers both Taiwanese ones and also ones from across Asia and other parts of the world to block messages and calls from likely fraudsters.Working with Taiwans Criminal Investigation Bureaus CIBs  165 Anti-Fraud Program  Whoscall blocked more 52.3 million scam messages and 13.1 million scam calls last year in Taiwan alone.But why is Taiwan such a hotbed for telecoms fraud Mr Kuo says the islands small population of 23.5 million makes it a perfect  practice ground  for organised criminals both Taiwanese gangs and those from mainland China and elsewhere . They try out a new phone scam in Taiwan and if it works there then they can expand it out across Asia and then globally .  For example we provide Apple with a lot of evidence ... until they realise there is a serious problem  says Mr Kuo .  A problem that is not only going to spread out in Taiwan but also in Asia Pacific and if they do n't take care of it very soon it will be in Europe and the US .  CIB telecoms fraud investigator Jean Hsiao Ya-yun tells the BBC that another reason why so many new scams originate on the island is the very fact that Taiwan is one of Asias top manufacturers of high-tech technology . She says this level of technical expertise is shared by Taiwanese scammers.Ms Hsiao adds that the coronavirus pandemic was a boom time for scammers as millions of people were stuck at home and therefore more reliant upon their phones .  And the Taiwan stock market was very high at the time so many people earned a lot of money  she says adding that this led to a big rise in investment scams .  Scammers would for example give advice on app pages or they would start a chat group saying that they can tell you when a stock is going to rise and they can share this intel if you join their group .  New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.The scammers would then ask for money for the information . Other such investment scams would see people receiving phone message from friendly strangers offering loans at very low rates.Such is the extent of the criminal networks behind the scamming that some Taiwanese gangs have opened up operations overseas . Ms Hsiao points to one case from 2020 when 92 Taiwanese people were arrested in Montenegro.In other cases Taiwanese people are lured overseas to countries such as Cambodia under the false promise of high wages . There they are forced to work against their will as telephone fraudsters as the BBC reported in September.Mr Kuo admits that there is a  weapons race  between anti-fraud firms like his and the fraudsters . And while Whoscall and similar apps block millions of messages and phone calls some still get through.Anyone who has lived in Taiwan regardless of age or nationality is familiar with one method used by fraudsters burst dialling . Answering an unknown number leads to you hearing a ief dialling sound and then a pre-recorded message starts playing.These calls are made by auto-dial systems capable of making hundreds a minute . Its an effective way for the fraudsters to find the working numbers of people who are prepared to answer their phone despite not knowing who is ringing them.Taiwanese cyber security expert TonTon Huang says that once such a person has been found scammers call back .  If they find the number is used by someone they will sell the active phone data or tell you that you need to pay a loan insurance payment or remit money  he says .  The most common one seems to be about instalment payments like you shopped online and you need to pay in instalments or something .  While scammers are often looking for older people who might not be familiar with technology or keep up with scam trends the CIBs Ms Hsiao says they still dupe plenty of young adults as well.Earlier this year a 20-something Taiwanese YouTuber Edison Lin posted a video on the platform in which he emotionally revealed that he had been a victim of telephone fraud.He had been conned out of $ 13,000 PS12,600 by two fraudsters working together.Mr Lin said it happened after he was called by someone pretending to an employee of a restaurant he had visited a few months earlier . The man told him that he had accidently been overcharged by $ 380 and that he would be offered assistance to get the money back.After Mr Lin had ended that call he was soon telephoned again this time by the other fraudster pretending to from his bank .  When the fake clerk from E.Sun Bank called he knew the whole story he told me how to get compensation from E.Sun  Mr Lin said in his video .  His professionalism made me think he was really a bank clerk .  Before long we were talking back and forth for half an hour ... and I noticed one of them was transferring my money ... I still have n't paid off the debt .  Prof Sandra Wachter a senior research fellow in AI at Oxford University is a global expert on the use of AI software systems.She says AI can be an effective tool in defending against telecoms and other tech-based fraud but that the general public also needs to be better educated about the risks .  Technology is being used to scale-up fraud attemptsC/| it allows scammers to cast a wider net and work more efficiently  she says .  At the same time some people might be more gullible and vulnerable to deceit because texting or calls seem legitimate especially if executed in convincing and sophisticated ways .  Since fraud is scaling up the strategy to combat these attempts must too scale up and so it makes sense to deploy AI software for this purpose .  The question is how effective these attempts are and if we will be able to fully stop this behaviour And the answer is probably not but we can curb it temporarily . Digital literacy and education can help people not to fall into the trap . AI can help to detect these scams and intervene .  Back at spam-blocking app Whoscall Jeff Kuo agrees saying fighting fraudsters  may be never-ending but so is our determination to sharpen our skills and stand up  .Biden disappointed Xi will not attend G20 summitTeacher suicide exposes parent bullying in S KoreaIndias Moon lander and rover put in sleep mode'Burning Man festivalgoers on the mood from the mudTeacher suicide exposes parent bullying in S KoreaLong wait for justice after India cough syrup deathsLagos traffic jams disappear .

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63646696|Challenges of running a small IT firm in South Africa; Ain drain of IT professionals from South Africa; Success of software start-ups in South Africa; Cricket video software system for player analysis|Stanford Mogotsi, the co-owner of Johannesburg-based software company Nane Solutions, remains committed to South Africa despite the challenges of running a small IT firm in the country. The shift from consulting to software development and the impact of South Africa's tough coronavirus lockdowns resulted in most of the company's founders leaving. The economic backdrop in South Africa is uncertain, making it difficult for small firms to compete with multinational IT companies. The IT sector in South Africa is facing a brain drain as many talented IT professionals are finding jobs overseas. The country's IT companies, like Nane Solutions, struggle to fill positions due to the salary gap compared to large firms overseas. The opportunities for IT professionals to move abroad are more easily available, resulting in a shortage of skilled workers in the sector. Despite the brain drain, South Africa still has successful software start-ups that are producing popular products. One example is the app EskomSePush, which warns users across South Africa about power cuts. The app, launched in 2015, has gained significant popularity with over 7 million devices and a million people clicking on notifications. It is monetized through advertising revenues. Computer science lecturers at the University of Johannesburg have developed a cricket video software system that aims to help produce the next generation of South African batsmen and women. The software can automatically identify different strokes played by a batsman, allowing quick analysis and improvement recommendations. The goal is to improve the skill level of batters and enhance the team's chances of winning.|I would n't leave South Africa I have a kid here|Y|Software firm boss Stanford Mogotsi says he remains committed to South Africa despite the challenges of running a small IT firm in the country .  Its my home I have a kid I have a family here  says the 47-year-old.Mr Mogotsi co-owns Johannesburg-based software company Nane Solutions with his friend and business partner Kabelo Mashishi 44.Both have come a long way since growing up in one of South Africas townships during apartheid.Each studied computer science at university and then spent a number of years in corporate IT jobs before launching Nane in 2006.Their initial work was consultancy advising firms such as MTN South Africas largest mobile phone network and state-owned power company Eskom.But they found consulting frustrating because they wanted to build software from the ground up rather than just advise.Their first major foray into designing software was creating a system for world football governing body Fifa to manage volunteers at the 2010 World Cup which was held in South Africa.Then in 2017 they created software that helped ewing group Heineken improve its transportation system in the country . Another big project win was developing an app for phone service Talk360.Yet it has n't all been plain sailing for the firm . Nane means eight in Swahili and the name was chosen because the company had eight founders.However the shift from consulting to the risker business of software development and then the impact of South Africas tough coronavirus lockdowns resulted in all but Mr Mogotsi and Mr Mashisi leaving the business .  Its really difficult to win work when you are a small firm  says Mr Mogotsi .  We have to compete with multinationals and potential clients tend to want to go for these tried and tested big IT firms especially when the economic backdrop in South Africa is uncertain .  Prof Duncan Coulter head of the Academy of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of Johannesburg agrees that times are difficult for South African IT companies like Nane.While Mr Mogotsi and Mr Mashisi are staying in South Africa Prof Coulter says that the continuing big problem for the countrys IT sector is a ain drain people finding jobs overseas .  A lot of our better students are now off in Europe America and Asia are doing very well for themselves we 're very proud of them  he says .  And as part of the general ain drain away from South Africa they definitely have opportunities to move more easily than professions like lawyer and doctors .  As a result of all these young IT professionals finding work overseas Prof Coulter says that firms in the sector in South Africa can now struggle to fill positions.Mr Mashisi says that  salary-wise we ca n't compete  with what large firms overseas can offer .  So as soon as someones got a year or twos worth of experience then its easy for them to be snapped up and go aoad .  New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Yet despite this ain drain South Africa still has successful software start-ups that are producing popular products.An example of this is the app EskomSePush which warns users across South Africa when to expect power cuts.Such power cuts or  load-sheddings  are a regular occurrence in the country due to the continuing energy generation shortfalls at power firm Eskom.Sometimes people have to go without power for 10 hours a day and theres no end in sight with shortfalls due to continue until 2027.EskomSePush is the ainchild of co-founders Dan Wells 35 and Herman Maritz who launched the app in 2015 and run it from their Cape Town homes.It collects and processes complicated load-shedding schedules from Eskom and local governments across South Africa . Notifications are then sent out to the apps users telling them exactly when the power will be out in their neighbourhood and for how long.Mr Wells says that within six months of launching the app 250,000 people had downloaded it  which was crazy back then  .He adds that today the app is  on seven million devices and about a million people will click on a notification almost immediately  .The app is monetised through advertising revenues and Mr Wells advise for software developers is  gain a taste for having problems find your community and solve some problems  .If there is one thing that unites South Africans it is a love of sport with cricket being the third most popular in the country.At the University of Johannesburg computer science lecturer Tevin Moodley and Prof Dustin van der Haar have developed a cricket video software system that aims to help produce the next generation of world-beating South African batsmen and women.Its software can automatically identify the different strokes played by a particular batsman from a recording of a test match or other game.This means that a cricket coach can play numerous clips of a certain shot without having to laboriously go through all the footage to first find them.This allows quick analysis of the players execution of the shot in question where they are standing and their foot placements . From that recommendations and improvements can be made and young players can compare their performance with video recordings of former cricketing greats .  My belief is if you 're able to improve the batters skill level you 're able to improve your teams chances of winning  says Mr Moodley .  So the impact of our work will be very big within the space of cricket .  At the moment Mr Moodley uses YouTube clips of test matches to collect footage but he hopes to work with Cricket South Africa to secure more videos.While the software is currently still in the research stage Mr Moodley says that given the right investors and stakeholders he would look to build a commercial product.But in the meantime his focus is trying to help the next generation of South African cricketers .  I want to keep it local and try to help our team  he says.Biden disappointed Xi will not attend G20 summitTeacher suicide exposes parent bullying in S KoreaIndias Moon lander and rover put in sleep mode'Burning Man festivalgoers on the mood from the mudTeacher suicide exposes parent bullying in S KoreaLong wait for justice after India cough syrup deathsLagos traffic jams disappear .

The demand for palm oil has led to significant deforestation, and C16 Biosciences aims to reduce the world's reliance on palm oil with their product called Palmless. The yeast is fed on sugars from sugar cane plants, and the process takes less than seven days from start to finish. Palm oil remains the most-produced vegetable oil in the world, accounting for 40% of the total. It is widely used in food and cosmetics due to its smooth texture, natural preservative properties, and ability to maintain its properties under high temperatures. Oil palms produce significantly more oil per hectare compared to other oil crops, making palm oil very productive. Another team led by Professor Chris Chuck at the University of Bath has developed a yeast-sourced alternative to palm oil. The team created a unique strain of yeast called Metschnikowia pulcherrima (MP) that is hardy, can be fed on grass and food waste, and produces high oil yields. The aim is for the oil to be as sustainable as possible, with lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to palm oil.|Lab-grown alternatives aim to cut palm oil dependence|Y|It was landing at Singapores international airport a decade ago that sparked Shara Tickus idea to create a lab-grown alternative to palm oil .  In 2013 I flew to Singapore and when I landed I had to wear a mask  says the boss of US tech firm C16 Biosciences .  The air was toxic because they were burning the rainforest in Indonesia .  Indonesian farmers who were clearing land for palm oil and other crops were blamed for the fires and the smoke that drifted across the sea to Singapore.Fast forward to today and her business has just commercially released an alternative to palm oil that is created from yeast cells.Palm oil remains the worlds most-produced vegetable oil accounting for 40 of the total according to the World Wide Fund for Nature WWF . It is supremely popular with food and cosmetics firms because it is so useful . Odourless tasteless and colourless it does n't alter the smell taste or look of products.Instead it adds a smooth texture and works as a natural preservative . And it maintains its properties under high temperatures also making it ideal for cooking with.In fact it is so widely used that palm oil or its derivatives are found in almost half of all products on supermarket shelves according to the WWF . This includes everything from chocolate to shampoo pizza toothpaste and deodorant .  No matter how hard you try every single person touches palm oil everyday  says Ms Ticku .  It is in everything .  The widely-documented problem with this usage is that this demand for palm oil has led to significant deforestation in areas where oil palm trees can grow low-lying hot wet areas near the equator.The use of this land for palm oil cultivation 85 of which is in Indonesia and Malaysia has increased almost nine-fold from 3.3 million hectares eight million acres in 1970 to 28.7 million hectares in 2020 . In financial terms one report valued the worldwide palm oil industry at $ 62.3bn PS51.2bn in 2021 . And such is the continuing growth in demand this figure is expected to increase to $ 75.7bn by 2028.To try to reduce the worlds reliance on palm oil Ms Ticku who was formerly an investment banker and her co-founders set up C16 Biosciences in New York City in 2018 . Backed by multi-million dollar funding from Microsoft founder Bill Gates the company has spent the past four years developing and finessing their product which is called Palmless.They grow a strain of yeast that naturally produces an oil with very similar properties to palm which they harvest . The yeast is fed on sugars from sugar cane plants grown on land already used for arable farming .  Our process takes less than seven days from start to finish  says a spokeswoman for C16 Biosciences .  For a traditional oil palm tree the oil would n't be ready to harvest until years after the seed is planted and most trees do n't reach peak production until seven years later .  She adds that the company is now  actively collaborating on partnerships in the beauty and home categories for example moisturisers nourishing oils soaps and cancels  .  And we plan to enter into food in 2024 .  Another reason for the continuing popularity of palm oil is that it is very productive .  You get so much more oil per hectare from oil palms than any other oil crop  says Chris Chuck professor of bioprocess engineering at the University of Bath .  Oil palms produce about 5,000 kg of oil per hectare per year rapeseed about 1,000 kg per hectare per year and soybean 400 kg per hectare per year .  Using other edible oils might take pressure off tropical forests he says but you 'd be sacrificing much more land to agriculture elsewhere.To reduce demand for palm oil Prof Chuck leads another team that has created its own yeast-sourced alternative.Prof Chuck says that he and his colleagues biologists chemists mechanical engineers chemical engineers and food scientists worked hard to find a yeast that was sufficiently robust and produced high oil yields .  You put the yeast in a horrendous environment forcing it to evolve so it can survive . You 're simply speeding up a natural process  he explains.After hundreds of generations of yeast and years of trial and error they arrived at a unique strain called Metschnikowia pulcherrima or MP for short.MP is said to be hardy and not fussy what it eats . It can be fed on grass and food waste . And at the point of harvesting its cells are full of oil.Even the leftover yeast cell biomass need not go to waste . It can be used for other products for example creating a substitute for soya protein.Prof Chuck says the aim is for the oil to be as sustainable as possible .  In the best case scenarios we 've modelled  he says  it could be even just a couple of percent of the greenhouse gas emissions from palm oil grown in Indonesia or Malaysia .  After a successful pilot the team is now ramping up to industrial scale . And a private business has been formed called Clean Food Group which recently partnered with a yet to be revealed UK supermarket.New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Prof Chuck hopes that in five years we could see 500,000-litre bioreactors similar to those used by major eweries producing the yeast and giving palm oil a run for its money.So can we live without palm oil Lab-developed alternatives could become a crucial tool in combating climate change caused by deforestation plus preventing biodiversity loss and future food insecurity .  Theres a lot of excitement and hype a lot of people rushing into this space . And thats great  says Prof Chuck .  The mounds of oil produced globally are so enormous theres space for everybody .

The microalgae extracts can be used in detergents, animal feed, packaging, and even as a replacement for plastic. This trend aligns with the growing demand for seaweed as a sustainable alternative to oil-based ingredients. Dr. Mari GranstrÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¶m, a Finnish biochemist, founded Origin by Ocean (ObO) to address the problem of toxic microalgae blooms in the Baltic Sea. ObO collects microalgae off the coast of Finland and imports invasive sargassum seaweed from the Caribbean. The company uses patented biorefinery technology to separate the algae into various usable materials, which are then sold to food, cosmetics, textiles, packaging, and agricultural companies. Nordic Seafarm, a commercial spin-off from the Swedish government-funded project Seafarm, is showcasing the versatility of seaweed. The company produces algae-based gin and beer and aims to scale up its operations if the market for seaweed expands. Additionally, Nordic Seafarm envisions algae becoming a key ingredient in animal feed, replacing environmentally-damaging fish meal.|Turning problem sea algae into a replacement for plastic|Y|Excessive outeaks of seaweed and microalgae are clogging up waters from the Caribbean to the Baltic . Now both are being harvested alongside farmed crops to create ingredients for cosmetics and food products.Mari GranstrPm says it was her passion for scuba diving that opened her eyes to the continuing problem of toxic microalgae blooms in the Baltic Sea.The outeaks occur when tiny cyanobacteria also called blue-green algae suddenly multiply rapidly stretching out on top of the water for potentially kilometres.Also called eutrophication it is a form of marine suffocation and it is a significant environmental concern in the Baltic Sea . It can occur in 97 of the total area of the sea according to official figures.The blooms impact on other marine life by causing oxygen deficiency reducing water quality and blocking out light.The problem is caused by too many nutrients entering the water typically nitrogen and phosphorus from artificial fertilisers . These are carried into the sea by the rivers of the surrounding countries Denmark Estonia Finland Germany Latvia Lithuania Poland Russia and Sweden.While the use of such fertilisers has reduced in recent years the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission the intergovernmental organisation that aims to improve water quality in the sea says  the effect of these measures has not yet been detected  .Some six years ago Dr GranstrPm a Finnish biochemist determined to tackle the problem herself . She 'd harvest the microalgae and use it to make ingredients for a host of products . In addition to cosmetics and human food the microalgae extracts can be used in detergents animal feed packaging and even as a replacement for plastic.This comes as there is a growing trend for seaweed to be harvested for such purposes as a replacement to oil-based ingredients .  I saw with my own eyes or perhaps could n't see how it was affecting the marine ecosystem and decided to do something  she says .  There was too much finger pointing and not enough action .  Dr GranstrPm says she worked on the project as  a hobby for a long time  before in 2019 setting up a company called Origin by Ocean ObO . She is the chief executive.The business which has attracted both commercial investment and European Union funds is now continuing with a pilot production scheme ahead of aiming to be fully operational by 2025-26.ObO collects the microalgae off the coast of Finland where it is sucked on to boats and then separated from the water . The firm is also importing invasive sargassum seaweed from the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean.Vast blooms of that seaweed have plagued that region for a number of years .  There are 25 million tonnes of sargassum blooming in the Caribbean every year  says Dr GranstrPm .  It stops people fishing and harms tourism . We are now buying several tonnes of sargassum from the Dominican Republic and this volume will increase .  The company further sources unwanted seaweed from Portuguese and Spanish waters.ObOs pilot processing is done at a facility in northern Finland . It uses a patented biorefinery technology it calls  Nauvu  to separate the algae into numerous useable materials.These are then sold to food cosmetics textiles packing and agricultural companies.New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.To help grow the business ObO is working with one of its investors Finnish chemicals and industrial group Kiilto .  If this can be successfully scaled up here then ObO can replicate similar processes around the globe  says Ville Solja Kiiltos chief business development officer.ObO already has plans to set up a refinery in the Dominican Republic.Across in Sweden a separate business called Nordic Seafarm is showing just how versatile seaweed can be .  We make algae-based gin and beer both locally produced  says director Fredrik GrPndahl.Nordic Seafarm which grows its own seaweed is a commercial spin-off from Seafarm a Swedish government-funded project that helps commercialise aquaculture research .  If this market for seaweed gets big and we think it will we are ready to scale up  adds Prof GrPndahl who is also project leader of Seafarm and head of department for sustainable development environmental science and engineering at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm .  Just imagine if Ikea asked for algae-based meatballs globally which could happen .  Prof GrPndahl also hopes that in the future algae will become a key ingredient in animal feed to replace environmentally-damaging fish meal which is common in pigs and poultry diets .  Algae is also cheaper than existing ingredients as there is no cost for feeding and irrigation .  Back at ObO Dr GranstrPm says the aim is for shoppers around the world to  play a part in cleaning up the Baltic Sea  by simply buying a number of consumer products .  We wanted to do something to help at both ends of the process upstream and downstream as it were cleaning the seas but also monetising a change in consumer behaviour .

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64486877|Alan Walker allows fans to invest in his singles; Corite offers a platform for up and coming artists to secure financial backing; Record labels still play an important role in the music industry|Electronic music artist Alan Walker has given around 8,000 fans the opportunity to invest in four of his singles, sharing his streaming revenues with them. He used the Swedish website and app called Corite to facilitate this, which handles all the financial details. This move allows Walker to involve his fans beyond just connecting with them through his music and stage performances. Corite, a Swedish website and app, allows up and coming artists to secure financial backing from their fanbase. Artists can announce campaigns for forthcoming releases and detail the amount of money they are seeking to raise. In return, fans can hope to earn more money than the sum they have invested, with rates of return typically between 1.4 and 1.7 times the investment amount. Despite the rise of streaming services and platforms like Corite, record labels still have an important role to play in the music industry. They have access to considerable capital, funding, marketing muscle, and media exposure, which can help artists be successful. While platforms like Corite offer artists a cheaper way of funding their careers, record labels provide support and resources that can be difficult to replicate independently.|'Investing in the artist makes me feel more involved in the song|Y|You might not have heard of an electronic music artist called Alan Walker but he has a significant fanbase.On YouTube the video of one of his songs Faded has been played 3.5 billon times and he has 42.9 million subscribers on the platform.It is a similar picture on Spotify where the Anglo-Norwegian music producer and DJ has numerous songs that have been listened to hundreds of millions of times.While bands and other musical artists have long argued that the streaming services do not pay them enough Walker who also earns money from live performances has amassed a net worth estimated to be as high as $ 20m PS16m . For the music industry the fans are normally just the consumers they pay to listen to the songs and albums attend the concerts and buy the merchandise . But last year Walker decided that he would start to allow his fanbase to share in his financial success.He has done this by giving around 8,000 fans the opportunity to invest in four of his singles sharing with them his streaming revenues . To facilitate this Walker has used a new Swedish website and app called Corite which handles all the financial details including the collection and exchanges of funds.New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape .  I wanted to involve my fans beyond just connecting with them on the stage and through my music  Walker tells the BBC .  We have raised just above $ 100,000 from fans in our projects so far but this number is not what makes me tick .  Its the thousands of backers that have participated in my projects that will now share the success with me .  Stockholm-based Corite is the ainchild of music industry veteran Mattias Tengblad who was previously commercial director for industry giant Universal Music Group.The idea behind Corite is that up and coming artists can skip signing with record labels which typically make more money from a successful artist than the artist make themselves.Under Corites model artists secure financial backing from their hopefully growing fanbase.In return fans can hope to earn more money than the sum they have invested . Although it is important to stress that they can lose money.The way it works is that an artist announces a  campaign  via Corite typically the forthcoming release of a single . They then detail how much money they are seeking to raise from just $ 500 up to tens of thousands and how much profit they will give to each investor if the song is streamed a certain number of times over the first year of its release.Typically the rates of return are between 1.4 and 1.7 times the amount a person invests . So if you put in $ 10 at 1.7 and the song reaches its one-year listening target you 'd get back a minimum of $ 17.And if the song greatly exceeds its streaming target the investors will get even more earnings . However it is a gamble as if the song flops and does n't hit its goal then the investors wo n't recoup as much money as they put in . Instead they may only get a few pounds or even just pennies back.To help people decide whether a song is worth investing in they can listen to a 30-second snippet via the Corite site . When the song is ready to release in full Corite uploads it to all the streaming services and collects and distributes the revenues to the artists and the fan investors .  We are challenging the status quo in the music industry  says Mr Tengblad .  Corite lets music lovers invest in the music that they love and artists that they love and get a piece of the success when songs are streaming on the likes of Spotify and Apple .  For the artists it can be a cheaper way of funding your career than signing an expensive deal with a record label that is going to take a much higher slice of their earnings . And even when a record company has all the best intentions in the world nowadays the social media world has made promotion much more complicated .  Record labels do n't know how to make things happen anymore and instead artists can use Corite to unleash the power of their fans who with money invested will become even more vocal cheerleaders . Yet at the end of the day you still need good songs to be successful .  But can artists really succeed without the support of a record label Jeremy Lascelles has been a music industry executive for more than 50 years . Today he is the co-founder and chief executive of Blue Raincoat Music which combines a record label with artist management and music publishing arm . He says that record companies still have a very important role to play .  The digital age has certainly shifted the power away from record labels but they are still a very attractive proposition for artists . They still have access to quite considerable capital and funding they have marketing muscle and they have access to media to radio TV and the like .  So when an artist releases a single or album you have an army of people at the record label there to help it be successful . Doing all that on your own is far more difficult .  One Alan Walker fan who has invested in one of his 2022 singles is student Effie Sampson who is doing a degree in games design at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston . She invested $ 35 and has so far got back $ 19.13 . However Ms Sampson says it is n't about the money .  I did it to support an artist that I love  she says .  And you feel more involved in the song when you listen to it .  It is this sense of closer involvement that business psychologist Stuart Duff a partner at UK practice Pearn Kandola thinks might be key to Corites future success .  While the financial transaction may be important of much greater value is the way that the investment will strengthen the relationship between the artist and fans  he says .  Without even realising it the artist is creating a stronger psychological bond with the fans .  Alan Walker says that for him using Corite and allowing fans to join in his financial success  offers me a way of giving back to the community of 'Walkers and showing my appreciation of what we 've built together  .Biden disappointed Xi will not attend G20 summitTeacher suicide exposes parent bullying in S KoreaIndias Moon lander and rover put in sleep mode'Burning Man festivalgoers on the mood from the mudTeacher suicide exposes parent bullying in S KoreaLong wait for justice after India cough syrup deathsLagos traffic jams disappear .

Despite his father-in-law, Mike Ashley, thinking the shops are 'bonkers,' Murray is showcasing his vision for aspirational shopping. This transformation has resulted in significant revenue growth for the premium lifestyle brands of Frasers Group. While Michael Murray sees Flannels as a successful venture, Mike Ashley finds it 'bonkers' and struggles to understand why people would spend so much on luxury clothing. However, Ashley acknowledges the need to be relevant to consumers and recognizes the positive results achieved by Flannels. The disagreement highlights the different perspectives between the two on the luxury retail market. Frasers Group's premium lifestyle brands, with Flannels as the main driver, have experienced significant revenue growth. However, the sports retail side of the business, including Sports Direct, still generates three times more revenue. Michael Murray aims to transform the business from a discount sports retailer to Europe's largest and most aspirational retailer, leaving a lasting legacy.|Mike Ashley thinks luxury Flannels shops 'bonkers|Y|Its never easy taking over a business especially when your predecessor is as successful and vocal as Mike Ashley.But a year after taking over as CEO of Frasers Group from his father-in-law Michael Murray told the BBC he is reinventing the company his way.He is targeting  new luxury aspirational  customers especially in his 60 Flannels shops which sell designer clothes.He admits his father-in-law however thinks the shops are  bonkers  .Frasers Groups best-known and remains Sports Direct which Mr Ashley founded in 1982 and built into a publicly-listed company . The Sports Direct empire was reanded as Frasers in 2019 and now includes the likes of Jack Wills Sofa.com Evans Cycles and House of Fraser as well as Flannels.Mr Murray 33 is married to Mr Ashleys eldest daughter Anna . Before he took over as CEO last year he was n't an employee of Sports Direct nor did he have a seat on the board . He earned millions of pounds in consultancy fees linked to a host of property deals he made for the group.Sports Direct originally made its name with cut-price deals on sports goods . Self-made billionaire Mr Ashley made headlines with revelations about his drinking exploits and his 14-year tenure as owner of Newcastle United Football Club.Mr Ashley 58 is still the majority shareholder in Frasers Group and Mr Murray says his father-in-law is very much involved in the business .  Mikes an expert operator  he says .  We call him 'The Mechanic he looks after the warehouse the supply chain hes optimising that engine .  Hes making sure the back-end system and the logistics keep up with the front end . Thats what he spends his day and night thinking about .  At family occasions like Christmas  business is all we talk about theres nothing else its our common interest .   Its difficult  Mr Murray says with a smile .  We 're both obsessed we live and eathe it .  But one area where Mr Ashley and his son-in-law do n't necessarily see eye-to-eye is Flannels where Mr Murray is showcasing his vision for  aspirational shopping  . If you look around the Flannels store on Londons Oxford Street you will see on display sports tops for PS600 trainers for PS400 and hoodies for PS300 . There are certainly no 2-for-1 sock deals which you will still spot in the Sports Direct store that stares at it from over the road.In the basement of the London Flannels store there is even an immersive digital art installation.So what does Mr Ashley make of Flannels  He thinks its bonkers  says Mr Murray .  He ca n't understand why people would spend so much on luxury clothing . But he understands that he does n't understand and he understands you have to be relevant to consumers .  He understands when he sees the results . Its quite remarkable what we 've done .  In its last set of results Frasers Groups  premium lifestyle  ands saw revenues of just over PS530m in the six months to the end of October last year up nearly 25 on the previous year with Flannels the biggest driver of that growth.The sports retail side of the business including Sports Direct still turns over around three times as much revenue as the premium lifestyle arm though it is not growing as rapidly.More CEO Secrets interviews Flannels has  ridden the wave of new aspirational shopping  says Mr Murray despite the cost of living crisis.Its target market is 18 to 30-year-olds who have been taught to aspire to expensive products by social media he says.Many are still living at home so have been sheltered from rising interest rates rents or high energy bills . They like to spend their disposable income on health fitness and clothing says Mr Murray.While Flannels may be his pride and joy Mr Murray admits it is not as scaleable as Sports Direct which is expanding internationally including into Asia.One year into the job he says he would like his legacy to be  the transformation of the business from a discount sports retailer to Europes biggest most aspirational retailer  .Sports Direct new boss warns prices are set to riseMike Ashley Who is the founder of Sports Direct Biden disappointed Xi will not attend G20 summitTeacher suicide exposes parent bullying in S KoreaIndias Moon lander and rover put in sleep mode'Burning Man festivalgoers on the mood from the mudTeacher suicide exposes parent bullying in S KoreaLong wait for justice after India cough syrup deathsLagos traffic jams disappear .

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65958967|Development of a Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Drive; Challenges in MHD Drive Development; Advantages and Future Potential of MHD Drives|The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) is working on a marine propulsion system called a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) drive, similar to the 'caterpillar drive' described in the movie 'The Hunt for Red October'. The MHD drive has no moving parts and works by generating a magnetic field at a right angle to an electric current, propelling the craft along silently. Engineers have been working on MHD drives for decades, and recent advancements in magnet technology may help solve some of the challenges associated with the drive. While advancements in magnet technology have made the development of a more powerful MHD drive possible, there are still challenges that need to be addressed. One challenge is protecting the electrodes from corrosion when placed in seawater and exposed to an electrical current. Coatings developed by the fuel cell and battery industries may help solve this problem. Another challenge is the resistance and reduced efficiency caused by gas bubbles created on the electrodes when a current is passed across seawater. Potential solutions include gas-diffusing electrodes and techniques to sweep away the bubbles. If the challenges associated with MHD drives can be overcome, the advantages would be significant. MHD drives would require less maintenance than existing propulsion systems due to their lack of moving parts. Additionally, they would be much quieter, which is advantageous for national defense and wildlife preservation. While commercial use of MHD drives may not be feasible in the next five years, it is a possibility for the future.|The US military revives an idea for stealthy sea power|Y|If you think I 'm doing The Hunt for Red October the answer is yes says Susan Swithenbank of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Darpa .The 1990 film starring Sean Connery featured a Soviet submarine Red October which had a near-silent propulsion system making it very difficult to detect.Now 30 years after the movie Darpa is working on a marine propulsion system similar to the  caterpillar drive  described in the movie.Called a magnetohydrodynamic MHD drive the system has no moving parts at all just magnets and an electric current.It works by generating a magnetic field at a right angle to an electric current . That creates a force called the Lorentz force which acts on the sea water and propels the craft along.Without propellers or a drive shaft churning up the water a working MHD drive could provide fast and completely silent travel.Engineers have been working on MHD drives for decades and the original concept dates back to the 1960s.In 1992 the Japanese Ship and Ocean Foundation built Yamato-1 a 30m-long ship that tested a MHD drive.However the drive was so heavy that the Yamato-1 could only manage to plod along at a speed of 6.6 knots . It also used up a lot of energy.But researchers say the project proved such a drive could work and provided useful data .  Authentic information on defects and weak points together with what should be made ... when we carry out a Yamato-2 in the future  says Hiromitsu Kitagawa visiting research fellow at the Ocean Policy Research Institute of which the Japanese Ship and Ocean Foundation is now part.The Yamato project showed that much more powerful magnets would be needed plus more robust electrodes the parts of the drive which make contact with the water.According to Ms Swithenbank the first of these problems may well be easily solvable now with a new generation of magnets developed by the nuclear fusion industry.Fusion is the reaction which powers stars . But to make it happen here on earth often requires extremely powerful magnets to contain swirling clouds of burning hot plasma.The force generated by these new magnets has been likened to double the pressure at the bottom of the deepest ocean trench.While more powerful magnets are now available the second problem how to protect the electrodes still needs work.Metal corrodes when placed in seawater and an electrical current accelerates that process . Some types of magnetic field have the same corrosive effect.On the Yamato-1 it was found that electrodes were losing around 3 of their mass per year.Jeffrey Long a research chemist at the US Naval Research Laboratory NRL is a battery specialist and is expecting to take part in the Darpa programme along with colleague Zachary Neale .  If you have ever placed paper clips in a cup of salt water connected to a 9-volt battery you 'd notice the water turns colour because the metal is corroding  he says .  Essentially we want electrodes that do n't corrode while still supporting the high electrical current density required for effective operation .  However improvements in coatings by the fuel cell and battery industries in recent years mean this problem may well now be solvable.While these are important advances other problems remain.Passing a current across seawater eaks the hydrogen-oxygen bond creating gas bubbles on the electrodes which creates resistance and reduces the efficiency of the MHD.Potential solutions will have to be tested including gas-diffusing electrodes created by the fuel cell industry . Other techniques sweep away the bubbles before they build up.Finally theres the issue of erosion with collapsing bubbles creating pitting .  Its like having sandpaper on your electrode  says Ms Swithenbank . Here too though work in other industries is showing promise.More technology of business If the Darpa team can overcome the problems the advantages will be enormous.Without moving parts MHD drives should need much less maintenance than existing propulsion systems .  But the real reason everybodys interested in it is that because theres no moving parts its also much quieter  says Ms Swithenbank .  Theres no question that for national defence thats a huge advantage .  A quiet system without dangerous propellers thrashing around could be better for wildlife as well.Work on the project will begin in earnest next spring with a two-year programme to develop materials in particular electrode materials followed by an 18-month period to design manufacture and test the drive . The aim is to produce a prototype MHD drive that could propel a small ship but that could be scaled up to propel a container ship or a military vessel . The drive would also have to demonstrate an energy efficiency that could match existing propeller systems .  Do I see this being used in commercial ships in the next five years No . But its absolutely possible in the future  say Ms Swithenbank.Biden disappointed Xi will not attend G20 summitTeacher suicide exposes parent bullying in S KoreaIndias Moon lander and rover put in sleep mode'Burning Man festivalgoers on the mood from the mudTeacher suicide exposes parent bullying in S KoreaLong wait for justice after India cough syrup deathsLagos traffic jams disappear .

This strategy is being implemented through the upcoming Barbie movie, which Kreiz began working on in 2018. The movie features Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken, with Greta Gerwig directing. Barbie, Mattel's biggest-selling brand, has faced criticism in the past for promoting unhealthy body image and reinforcing stereotypes. However, Mattel has learned from these issues and now focuses on diversity and inclusivity. Barbie now offers dolls with different body shapes, skin colors, and disabilities, reflecting the changing times and promoting exploration of different potentials. Mattel is restructuring its company to adapt to the changing times and move away from gender-specific products. The company aims to position itself as a talent magnet, collaborating with film directors and other creative individuals to bring new ideas to its well-known creations. Mattel recognizes that its customers are not just consumers but fans with emotional connections to their products.|Can Barbie be the new Iron Man in a Mattel universe|Y|It may sound like an unlikely comparison but the boss of toy company Mattel would like Barbie to be the next Iron Man . Thats because Ynon Kreiz aspires to create a  Mattel universe  he tells me emulating the success of the Marvel universe which has spawned dozens of hit films for Disney from a cast of comic-book characters like Thor Captain America and Guardians of the Galaxy.This is the strategy behind the Barbie movie which comes out on 21 July . Kreiz began working on it when he became CEO of Mattel in 2018 and he remains executive producer . Barbie and Ken are played by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling with Greta Gerwig directing.Kreiz acknowledges there is some risk in giving Barbie the Hollywood treatment working with directors and writers who have their own creative ideas.There is  humour and self-deprecation  in the film he says not least on his part as he is played by Will Ferrell a controlling and slightly stuffy CEO .Its clear even from the trailer that Barbie is the butt of jokes . If you 're being generous she is portrayed as na-ve and innocent . If you are n't shes shallow and superficial obsessed with appearance and unable to comprehend the meaning of sex death or life without high heels.Barbies  Dreamland  is a pink utopia divorced from reality .  This movie has been 64 years in the making Barbie launched in 1959  says Kreiz  but it represents how the culture sees Barbie today .  Barbie remains Mattels biggest-selling and making the company more than PS1bn $ 1.5bn annually . Its other ands include Hot Wheels Masters of the Universe Monster High Bob the Builder and Thomas the Tank Engine.Kreiz argues Mattels other ands also have the potential to be turned into successful spin-offs .  The devil works hard but Barbies marketing team is working harder  according to marketing expert Mike Buonaiuto author of Founder Therapy who admires the inventive advertising the team behind the film has been up to including the Airbnb listing of a Barbie Dreamhouse .  But lets be honest  Buonaiuto points out  the opportunity for the Mattel universe is vastly different to Marvels and whilst Barbie is being powered by millennial nostalgia collaborations try and do the same for Thomas the Tank Engine or Hot Wheels and you probably wo n't get the same result .  The depth of world-building Mattel can pull from is n't competition for Marvels .  But the recent collapse of Toys R Us shows why toymakers like Mattel need to diversify beyond the sale of physical products adds Buonaiuto.Barbie was first introduced in America in 1959 developed by Ruth Handler co-founder of Mattel . Before Barbie dolls typically took the form of babies so children could play at being a nurturing parent . However Barbies encouraged children to play at being adolescents imagining their future selves through the dolls.As the original TV adverts that ran during Mickey Mouse Club told children  Someday I 'm going to be exactly like you .  This proved alluring and good business . More than a billion Barbie dolls had been sold by the early 1990s.But there have also been questions about what exactly Barbie dolls teach children especially around body image . The original Barbie design was extremely skinny and the messaging reinforced unhealthy ideas . One infamous slumber party set created in the mid-1960s featured bathroom scales fixed at 110 pounds 50kg and a dieting book that advised  Do n't eat  .Another talking Barbie created in the early 1990s had the doll saying  Math class is tough .  Mattel later apologised . These issues continued to affect peoples perception of the and and arguably lay behind a dip in popularity around a decade ago.Mattel has learned lessons and is now keeping up with the times says Kreiz .  Barbie is a flag carrier for diversity and inclusivity  he says  with more than 170 different Barbie types in terms of body shape and skin colour and Barbie has more than 200 careers so girls can explore their potential in different ways .  Barbie has recently ought out dolls with disabilities prosthetic limbs and one with Downs Syndrome . The  classic traditional Barbie  is less than half of the business now says Kreiz.That new commitment to diversity is reflected in the cast of the film while the classic Barbie who is the central character is gently mocked.More CEO Secrets interviews Kreiz also points out that Mattel is restructuring the company to move with the times.Now it simply divides its products into categories like dolls vehicles and pre-school rather than having teams devoted to separate boys and girls products . This is despite the fact that many shops still divide toys by gender with pink aisles for girls who want to be princesses and blue ones for boys who like dinosaurs and construction sets.The Barbie film is part of Kreizs masterplan to position Mattel as a  talent magnet  working with people like film directors to try different things with its well-known creations .  People who buy our products are n't just consumers  says Kreiz .  They are fans who have an emotional relationship to the products . Kids touch hug and go to bed with our toys .  We believe in the long-term opportunity for Barbie . But we need to evolve her keep her relevant and in the centre of cultural conversation .

These apprenticeships provide opportunities for individuals to learn and apply skills in real-world settings, such as cyber security and manufacturing engineering. IBM is actively recruiting individuals without degrees to create a more diverse workforce. The company recognizes that academic qualifications do not necessarily reflect a person's potential and transferable skills. By removing degree requirements from many job listings, IBM aims to provide equal opportunities for career growth and development. The tech industry is shifting its focus from academic qualifications to skills and experience. Companies like IBM are realizing that degrees are not always necessary for certain tech roles, such as software quality assurance. Instead, they are looking for individuals with relevant skills, such as teamwork, client focus, and communication, which can be acquired through alternative learning paths like bootcamps and self-guided courses.|Do you need a degree to work in tech|Y|I had a lot of people telling me university was the way to go says Travis Williams  but with my learning style working with technology helps me to understand it better .  Mr Williams is an apprentice at Virgin O2 one of around 740,400 apprentices across England.For school leavers who do n't want to or ca n't go to university apprenticeships offer an alternative route into many tech companies.Mr Williams joined Virgin Media O2 as a cyber security apprentice a year and a half ago . Before that he got A levels in IT and cyber security at college and then went on to work at a different college in IT primarily offering helpdesk support.Now Mr Williams is responsible for setting up maintaining and monitoring security systems at Virgin Media O2 for both network and data centre infrastructure . Hes become a go-to-person if there is an problem in the Intrusion Prevention System which monitors the network for unauthorised activities .  If theres an issue with that they 'll come to me or one of my colleagues  he says .  Its a lot of responsibility but its very exciting to have that experience .  What was the company looking for in him  Not so much someone who has all the answers but someone who shows an interest and a willingness to learn as much as possible  says Mr Williams .  Mentioning that I played around with network analysis tools at home helped to show that .   The best thing about an apprenticeship is being able to learn the skills you need and then also sometimes being able to apply them the very same day  he says .  I think university is great but it will never give you that working experience .  Elsewhere BAE Systems plans to recruit 1,400 apprentices this year . Hollie Keenan left school after her GCSEs and joined BAE Systems advanced apprenticeship in 2019 . She works at the submarine shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness . As an associate manufacturing engineer she uses a virtual reality headset to check the submarine for potential problems before it goes into production.She never considered going to university .  Where I live all that was talked about was apprenticeships  she says .  All my family came to BAE through the apprenticeship scheme and have gone on to do other things in the business .  The apprenticeship is a three-and-a-half year programme . Ms Keenans first year was spent mostly in college learning tool skills in the electrical mechanical and pipes workshops . In the second year she spent one day a week at college studying topics such as materials and health and safety.Although shes begun her career shes considering starting a degree in a couple of years .  It opens doors if I wanted to go somewhere else  she says.IBM is hiring people without degrees to help it recruit a more diverse workforce .  There are illiant people everywhere but opportunity is not the same for everyone  says Jenny Taylor MBE who leads the companys early professional programmes .  Our clients are diverse . Why would n't you want to seek talent from every avenue that you can  In a survey of employers by skills development organisation Generation 52 of respondents said they struggle to fill entry-level tech positions.Whether people join IBM as apprentices or graduates the company is looking for the same transferable skills .  If you 've worked in a bar you 'll have teamwork client focus and communication skills  says Ms Taylor .  You 'll have dealt with difficult people . We 're much more interested in the person than the academic qualifications .  As well as having entry-level programmes IBM has removed degree requirements from many other job listings so people are n't disadvantaged later in their careers.More technology of business Research by The Burning Glass Institute found that only 29 of IBMs listings for a Software Quality Assurance QA Engineer in the US required a degree . By comparison it was between 90 and 100 at four other big-name tech companies .  They 're behind the curve  says Robin MacDonald director at tech recruitment company Harvey Nash .  They just have n't changed their ways . They 'll have to . Theres no reason a QA needs to have a degree to do that job . We can train those people in months .  He adds  If you 're hiring for programmers at entry level and only looking at people with computer science degrees you 're not going to have a gender split because 90 of the courses are filled with males .  Bootcamps offer short and intensive in-person courses to rapidly skill up in tech and lots of self-guided courses are available online .  I was pretty surprised when I found out that Harvards introduction to computer science CS50 is available for free online for anyone to learn  says Vesko Trakiyski technology director at digital marketing agency Fifty.io.He dropped out of school at the age of 15 and taught himself web design and tech skills for the next two years including through the Harvard course . At 17 he got his first job as an entry-level web developer . Two years later he joined start-up Fifty.io as a junior developer . Eight years on the company is 10 times bigger and he is technology director .  I do n't think I 'd be at this level in my career development if I 'd first started looking for a job after graduating uni .   Tech is one of those industries where you genuinely do n't need a degree to find a job and have a career  he says .  Its quite unconventional risky and weird to not go down the established path but if you know you want to do a certain role in some cases there is a different path thats open .  Like Mr Trakiyski Daniele Servadei taught himself to code . He is studying for a degree in computer science though despite already having set up an online business . He co-founded Sellix in 2021 which enables people to get paid for digital products . Its now processed around $ 80m PS61m in payments for 280,000 merchants .  When you have an idea you should immediately get going with it  he says .  Do n't wait to perfect the idea . When we initially launched Sellix it only had a couple of features .  He recognises that there are important aspects of computer science he has yet to learn but his main motivation for going to university was to build contacts .  There are many people at university that want to learn and have the same ideas as you  he says .  The best thing is the university atmosphere .  There are advantages to tuition over self-guided learning . When you 're teaching yourself you can make programs that work but that might not use the best approach Mr Servadei says . A teacher will spot that and help you . Hes also found that university courses are structured to guide your learning in a logical order whereas online documentation often isn't.He recommends students complement their studies with their own learning . His course teaches the C programming language but JavaScript and Python are the languages needed for many jobs today .  You need to see what the market needs you to know and study that as well  he says .  Do n't just trust that the teacher knows everything about everything in the computer science world .

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66252187|Volocopter's VoloCity aircraft; Lilium's larger EVTOL aircraft; Challenges in battery technology for EVTOL aircraft|Volocopter, an aviation start-up, plans to launch its two-seater electric aircraft, VoloCity, in Paris in time for the Summer Olympics. This will be the first service in Europe to use an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft. Volocopter expects to receive clearance from the European aerospace regulator to carry passengers in the next few months and aims to offer three routes connecting the center of Paris with the city's airports and heliport. German-based Lilium has developed a larger EVTOL aircraft designed to carry up to six passengers. Unlike Volocopter, Lilium uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted for vertical lift and forward flight. Lilium expects to receive certification from the European aerospace regulator in 2025 and sees potential in offering connections around congested cities or areas with poor rail links. Both Volocopter and Lilium face challenges in battery technology for their EVTOL aircraft. Batteries remain heavy and expensive, limiting the range and cost advantages of EVTOL aircraft over helicopters, trains, and cars. However, both companies are optimistic about advancements in battery technology, expecting more powerful and cheaper batteries to emerge in the future, enabling them to build larger aircraft and offer services at lower prices.|Will electric flying taxis live up to their promise|Y|This video can not be playedVolocopters VoloCity aircraftIn a years time the Summer Olympics will be underway in Paris . The athletes will of course be hoping to make history but so will one aviation start-up Volocopter.If all goes to plan its two-seater electric aircraft VoloCity will be carrying passengers around Paris . It will be the first service in Europe to use an electric vertical take-off and landing EVTOL aircraft.Dozens of companies around the world have been developing EVTOL aircraft promising quieter cheaper and emission-free aircraft that can land right in the heart of cities.Volocopter expects to get the European aerospace regulator EASA to clear its machine the VoloCity to carry passengers in the next few months so they can be ready for the Olympics .  Everything is ready and set to go for the middle of next year  says Christian Bauer the German companys chief financial officer.Three routes will connect the centre of Paris with the citys airports and heliport . Volocopter will also offer round trips for sightseeing.Much work has gone into organising flight paths and landing spots called vertiports not easy in a crowded city like Paris . Add to that the technical challenge of developing and getting certification for a new aircraft and its clear Volocopter has achieved a lot in its 12-year history.But some would argue that the biggest challenges lie ahead for Volocopter and its rivals . In the coming years they will need to show that there is a market for their aircraft . Batteries remain the biggest problem . They remain heavy and expensive which curtails the range and limits the cost advantages of EVTOL aircraft over helicopters trains and cars.The VoloCity has a range of 22 miles which is enough for short city hops but is not very far compared to the range of a helicopter.Mr Bauer acknowledges the challenge  What is hindering us is right now the battery technology which all the peers are right now working on .  He says that more powerful cheaper batteries will emerge allowing Volocopter to build a bigger aircraft that will be able to offer services at lower prices .  We will be starting with more premium prices at around a helicopter segment pricing . And then we will gradually go down with a big step when we have a four-or-five seater model in place  he says.Lilium also based in Germany has already developed a larger EVTOL . Designed to carry up to six passengers it is an elegant looking machine.Rather than using rotors like Volocopter Lilium uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight . It expects to get certification from EASA in 2025.Lilium says there is potentially a huge market for such an aircraft which can offer connections around congested cities or services where rail links are poor .  Where you have a good train connection at low cost ... we would n't want to compete with it . We come into play when there is no infrastructure and infrastructure is difficult to build  says Lilium chief executive Klaus Roewe.He points to a deal announced in June under which Shenzhen Eastern General Aviation Heli-Eastern plans to buy 100 Lilium aircraft.Heli-Eastern runs air links in the Greater Bay region of China which includes Hong Kong Shenzhen and Macao . With mountains many islands and peninsulas it can be a  nightmare  to get around says Mr Roewe.But like Volocopter Lilium is banking on improving battery technology to make its aircraft competitive.Mr Roewe says there remains  uncertainty  over the costs of batteries but he believes prices will go down and capacity will go up . He thinks the EVTOL industry can piggyback on the advances made in batteries for cars .  There is no reason why our batteries should be more expensive than any automotive battery because the production process is exactly the same  says Mr Roewe.Despite that optimism some experts are sceptical about the expectations of the EVTOL industry when it comes to batteries .  They EVTOL aircraft actually have a very special battery set thats a very low production and very expensive production and will not reach high volumes any time soon  says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force . He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.Mr Fehrm points out that to take off and fly EVTOL aircraft draw power from the battery much more quickly than a car does from its battery . Also to be economic the aircraft would need to be charged quickly . The quick charge and discharge puts a heavy toll on the battery requiring a different and more expensive system than that of a car Mr Fehrm says . He does see future improvement but probably batteries only  twice  as good by the end of this decade.More technology of business Mr Fehrm says the present lack of battery capacity limits the conditions that EVTOL aircraft can fly in . For example a helicopter is likely to have the range to fly around a storm EVTOL aircraft with a much more limited range would not be able to do that . As well as improving the battery technology the new EVTOL firms will have to set up factories to produce their aircraft in greater numbers.Thats likely to be an expensive process as EVTOL aircraft use the same processes as the aircraft industry which are not suitable for low-cost high-rate production according to Mr Fehrm.Darrell Swanson an aviation consultant who specialises in electric aviation agrees that battery technology rollout is  a challenging process but it is accelerating  .He also makes the point that the new firms will have to get much bigger  It is crucial for the industry to scale-up to avoid adopting a model limited to business travellers or financially privileged individuals .  In April Volocopter opened its first assembly line in Bruchsal near Stuttgart in southern Germany capable of producing 50 aircraft a year but it hopes by the end of the decade to be producing between 5,000 and 7,000 aircraft every year.Mr Bauer acknowledges that there is much work and investment to be done .  I would say we are at the last step of the first marathon to certify that vehicle . So then the next marathon begins to get to profitability .

With increasing concerns about climate change, proponents of wind-powered ships argue that sometimes old technology is the best new technology. Ecoclipper aims to build a fleet of up to 25 wind-powered cargo ships in the future. According to Gavin Allwright, secretary of the International Windship Association, wind-powered cargo shipping is making a comeback since 2012. The cost of fuel and the introduction of carbon taxes are driving the resurgence. Some historic sail cargo systems still exist, such as the Dhows of the Indian Ocean and small vessels in the South Pacific. Raybel, a 1920s Thames barge, is currently being restored in Sittingbourne, Kent. Once the restoration is complete, it will transport items like olives, coffee, and wine along the Kent coast and into London. The project aims to utilize traditional UK waterways and connect estuaries to oceans and canals.|The return of cargo-carrying sail ships|Y|Jorne Langelaan is beaming as he shows me around De Tukker a traditional two-mast Dutch sail barge that was built in 1912.A shipping enthusiast since he was a child thanks to his grandfather working in the industry Mr Langelaan has spent the past two years restoring the vessel with the aim of returning it to its original role transporting cargo.Last month the ship set sail on its first commercial voyage under the ownership of Mr Langelaans company Ecoclipper.Carrying mixed loads that included everything from cheese to wine and olive oil the 40-metre 131ft long craft travelled from Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Porto in Portugal and back again . With stops in Spain France and England.De Tukker can carry 70 tonnes of cargo and up to 12 passengers . In her previous life she transported building supplies and produce along the Dutch and German coasts.Wind-powered cargo ships ruled the worlds waves back in the 19th Century . Then the adoption of the steam engine saw them replaced by much-larger coal-powered alternatives.Todays giant container ships mostly use heavy fuel oil with the sector said to contribute 3 of global carbon emissions . Given increasing concerns about climate change proponents of returning to wind-powered ships to transport cargo say that sometimes old tech is the best new tech.Mr Langelaan now in his mid-40s says he first decided that we needed to return to sail cargo ships when he was in his early 20s.At the time he was working alongside climate researchers and biologists on expeditions to Antarctica as a crew member on a historical tall sail ship called Bark Europa .  If we want to stick to the Paris Agreement on climate change we really need to keep fossil fuels in the ground  says Ecoclippers chief executive .  Wind-powered sailing is actually the only feasible way to continue with long-distance transport and travel in the future .  Theres no denying that sailing is slower . Mr Langelaan says it would take 70 days to sail from China to Europe whereas a modern container ship can do the journey in 30 to 40 days.And of course container ships are enormous the largest can move 20,500 containers and a total weight of 210,000 tonnes.De Tukker can only haul a tiny fraction of that with her 70 cubic meters of cargo space making her a more expensive way to ship cargo.Yet Mr Langelaan adds that people do n't see the  true ecological price  of container ships .  The price of people falling ill due to the climate change for instance . Thats never paid for .  Stephen Gordon is managing director of Clarksons Research which gives expert analysis of the container shipping sector . He counters that the industry has been investing in more efficient fuel systems including more than 60 of new ships ordered last year.Mr Gordon says that some ships have even had small sails fitted so as to reduce the amount of fuel they need to consume . However this currently only numbers 50 vessels out of the global total of 100,000.To purchase De Tukker Ecoclipper raised C/!600,000 $ 663,000 PS516,000 through crowdfunding and private investors.Ecoclipper hopes to build a fleet of up to 25 wind-powered cargo ships in the future utilising the latest design technology . Each will be 10 times larger than De Tukker and cost in the region of C/!9m each .  The big goal of Ecoclipper is to connect the continents to offer emission-free cargo shipping  says Mr Langelaan.Gavin Allwright is secretary of the International Windship Association which now has more than 150 members from 50 countries . He says that wind-powered cargo shipping is making a comeback .  Since 2012 wind power has been growing  he says .  Its a small niche sector but they 're making a comeback in the Western developed world .  One driver is the cost of fuel which has been increasing and carbon taxes are coming in . And there are still vestiges of historic sail cargo systems for example the Dhows of the Indian Ocean and some small vessels in operation in areas of the South Pacific .  In the US a 20m 64ft steel-hulled schooner sailboat called Apollonia has been transporting cargo up and down the Hudson River in New York State since 2020.The ships captain and owner Sam Merritt purchased the 77-year-old vessel for $ 15,000 PS11,500 in 2015 and then spent five years restoring it . It can carry up to 10 US tons nine metric tonnes of cargo and travels for 250 nautical miles between Brooklyn in New York City and the city of Hudson in Upstate New York and back again . It ships more than 50 products including barley malt its biggest cargo maple syrup and chilli sauce.Mr Merritts previous job had seen him working to develop alternatives to oil for the fuel sector . He turned to shipping after realising that cargo could be transported through sailing .  With sailing I can feel good about the whole process  he says .  I do n't like roads and cars and as much as I love trying to use vegetable oil for cars it does n't change the system .  Sailing cargo really does . I love the relationship with the river . Its illiant to slow down and interact with waterfronts and constantly be part of conversations in towns .  New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.However he says they are not profitable yet .  We are in start-up phase . Theres a lot of obstacles with the infrastructure but the goal is to be profitable within the next two years and hopefully that will encourage others to join in .  Another vessel soon to re-join the resurgence in wind-powered cargo sailing is Raybel a 1920s Thames barge currently being restored in Sittingbourne in Kent.Once the restoration is complete she will transport items like olives coffee and wine along the Kent coast and into London . In the ships old life she used to transport icks along the same route .  Its about utilising traditional UK waterways a lot more and connecting estuaries to oceans and canals  says Faye Thorley project manager for Raybel Charters.She is also the coordinator for two organisations set up to help small-scale producers see their organic fair-trade goods transported via wind-powered sailing vessels Sail Cargo London and Kent Sail Cargo .  We have a lot of demand but do n't have supply of ships  says Ms Thorley.Mr Langelaan is happy to see ands rethink their transport strategies for environmental reasons .  Theres smaller almost hipster-like companies who are radically deciding they want to reduce their transport emissions .

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66310714|Concerns about Digital Sovereignty in Europe; Evroc's Plan to Build Europes First Sovereign Hyperscale Cloud; Efforts to Form a Federated System of European Cloud Service Providers|There is a concern in Europe about digital sovereignty, which refers to the region's ability to control its own data and technology. Europe heavily relies on US firms for cloud services, which has raised concerns about conflicts between EU data protection laws and US laws that grant broad access to data by intelligence and law-enforcement services. To address this, European companies like Evroc and Ionos are working towards creating European alternatives to US tech giants in the cloud computing industry. Evroc, a Stockholm-based company, aims to create Europes first sovereign hyperscale cloud, fully under the jurisdiction of European law. The company has secured C/!15m in seed funding and plans to build eight data centers in Europe over the next five years. By offering an alternative to major US cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google, Evroc aims to promote technological independence and strengthen Europe's digital sovereignty. European cloud providers, including Ionos, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, are participating in the Gaia-X project, which aims to create a federated system for cloud services. The goal is to enable data to move between different cloud service providers while ensuring data owners remain in control. By collaborating and sharing an ecosystem, European cloud providers believe they can compete with major US tech giants and strengthen Europe's position in the cloud computing market.|Why it matters where your data is stored|Y|Mattias  strPm glances out of the office window in France .  Look at all the beautiful roads and idges here  says the founder and chief executive of Evroc .  You can see what we built hundreds of years ago . Now we 're letting foreign companies build our critical infrastructure .  Hes talking about digital infrastructure the hardware and software data centres and communications networks that power modern business . There is a concern in Europe about digital sovereignty the regions ability to control its own data and technology . For example Europe is heavily dependent on US firms for cloud services the remote computing and data storage services dominated by US companies including Amazon and Microsoft.This has been a potential cause of problems when the data of European customers is stored in a US cloud service as there can be a conflict between the laws that apply.The General Data Protection Regulation GDPR requires organisations in the EU to protect personal data and the UK has equivalent data protection laws.At the same time US laws have given intelligence and law-enforcement services oad powers to access data . That conflict was underlined In May when Facebook was fined a record C/!1.2bn PS1bn for having inadequate safeguards for data sent from the EU to the US.However in July the European Commission decided that the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework which US firms will be able to join gives  an adequate level of protection  for personal data transferred to the US.Mr  strPm is the founder and chief executive of Evroc which is headquartered in Stockholm.The firm believes theres an opportunity to create what it calls Europes first  sovereign hyperscale cloud  .That means its fully under the jurisdiction of European law and its big enough to rival the major US cloud providers Amazon Web Services AWS Microsoft and Google . They have a 65 share of the world cloud market between them according to Synergy Research Group . Evroc has secured C/!15m in seed funding and plans to build eight data centres in Europe in the next five years . The first will be a large pilot data centre in Sweden next year.Mr  strPm sees technological independence from the US as a critical aspect of digital sovereignty .  We 've seen the US restricting certain components from being exported to China  he says .  Lets say there is a conflict in China and Taiwan . What do you think will happen if computing is a scarce resource Do you think the US will look after its own interests or help their European friends  Cloud computing firm Ionos already positions itself as the European alternative to US tech giants out of the reach of the US Cloud Act.Thats the law that allows US authorities to request data stored by cloud companies that work in the US even if the data is outside the US . The request must meet the legal standards for a judge to issue a warrant as part of a criminal investigation . Ionos develops all its software in Europe and its European servers are isolated from the US .  Its about trust  says Rainer Straeter its head of cloud development and digital ecosystems .  Do we really think that the Cloud Act will hit a small business around the corner We do n't know . This 'do n't know makes us a bit nervous .  Responding to the issue of digital sovereignty a spokesperson for Amazon Web Services said  Our bi-annual transparency reports note that there have been no data requests to AWS that resulted in disclosure of data stored outside the US to the US government . This statement was added to the transparency report in 2020 and has been re-affirmed every six months since then .  In addition the firm said  AWS will challenge any law enforcement request for customer data from any governmental bodies where the request conflicts with EU law is overoad or we otherwise have any appropriate grounds to do so .  Nevertheless European firms continue their efforts to form cloud services.Ionos is among 377 organisations participating in the Gaia-X project which aims to join up cloud service providers in a federated system so data can move between them while data owners remain in control.It also counts the European divisions of Microsoft Google and Amazon among its members.However Mr Straeter says that if European cloud providers band together they can take on the US tech giants .  None of the European cloud providers can build everything on their own to compete with AWS  says Mr Straeter .  The resources available are not enough . We have to take the European way be a bit cleverer than anybody else and define standards . If all the European cloud providers were able to share an ecosystem we would be much stronger than AWS Google and Microsoft .  Mr Straeter believes its important for Europe to have resilient infrastructure following a run of crises that include the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009 Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine .  Federated networks are more resilient more stable  Mr Straeter says .  We know this from the domain name system in the internet . Its rock solid because its super distributed .  More technology of business Another part of digital sovereignty is how a country or region balances free speech with protecting its citizens . The Online Safety Bill going though UK parliament now will require social media platforms to remove illegal content quickly enforce age checks and stop children seeing harmful content .  Some of this is terrifying to US companies who are used to operating in the shadow of the first amendment  says Mark Weston partner and head of technology law at law firm Hill Dickinson .  The first amendment says as long as you 're not causing direct harm to somebody you can say whatever you like and set yourself up in whatever way you like . The UK is asserting its digital sovereignty and saying this is harming our citizens and therefore we want social media companies while they 're in our jurisdiction to operate in this way .  Data laws in the UK and EU apply to citizens even if their data is processed overseas he says .  If you are holding personal data of residents from the UK and the EU on US servers you 're caught within the UK and the EU legislation  says Mr Weston.People and firms who are concerned about digital sovereignty may also want to think about the number of companies involved in hosting their data according to Simon Yeoman chief executive of cloud company Fasthosts .  The supply chain is where it starts to unravel  he says .  You might work with a managed service provider based in Birmingham UK and they might work with a UK data centre but they might back up to Google . You have to ask those follow-up questions around the supply chain to really understand how sovereign you are  he says.Barry Cashman has some reassuring words for people who are worried that US authorities can get easy access to corporate data.He works for Veritas Technologies a US firm which manages data for thousands of companies all over the world .  Concerns that EU companies and citizens have about their data being exported outside of the EU to countries with different privacy regimes are valid but its important to remember that the EU-US Data Framework that recently came into force does provide safeguards for the use of personal data by US national security agencies .

They rely on solar panels for electricity, strategically plan their energy usage, and make sacrifices when it comes to energy-gobbling devices. They have also invested in more efficient inverters and lithium batteries for better energy storage. Narrowboaters face challenges in managing their energy usage, especially during winter. They have to strategize which electrical devices to use simultaneously to avoid overloading the system. Some boaters go without refrigerators or cool boxes, and certain devices like hairdryers and irons are nearly impossible to run. The cost of solar installation remains high, although the technology has improved. Environmental restrictions, such as eco-mooring zones and smoke control areas, have caused controversy among narrowboaters in London. Some argue that narrowboat living is already environmentally conscious, while others highlight the financial and space limitations of upgrading energy systems. There is a need for financial support and increased connections to mains electricity to help narrowboaters meet the requirements.|Can narrowboat owners eak up with fossil fuels|Y|Narrowboat dwellers are some of the most energy-conscious people in London . And Amy Cross and Wes Arthur are no exception . The couple have spent much of the summer navigating Londons waterways on their slim 50-foot boat . As continuous cruisers they 're required to change their mooring locations every two weeks . Continuous cruisers ca n't count on prized permanent moorings with electricity points.Miss Cross and Mr Arthur who make chatty YouTube videos under the handle Boat Time have three solar panels that provide most of their electricity in the summer while still leaving enough space for them to picnic and grow plants on the boats roof .  We are just extremely aware of how much power we are using at any given moment  says Mr Arthur . They regularly check an app that indicates how much power is being drawn and how much is left . Like many permanent boaters they 've had to make sacrifices when it comes to energy-gobbling devices . Miss Cross has given up her hair straighteners for instance.Both are big computer gamers who also work in the gaming industry she as a streamer on gaming platform Twitch and he as a designer.Miss Cross and Mr Arthur had to downscale their extensive six-monitor computing setup once they moved onto the boat in 2021.Still the power-hungry software Mr Arthur uses for game development on his laptop takes up most of their power on weekdays . Sometimes Miss Cross can only stream during the day when theres abundant solar power .  Some games we ca n't play in the winter  Miss Cross says.Like the Boat Time duo its common for narrowboaters to strategise which electrical devices are plugged in at the same time so as not to overload the system . In winter some boaters go without refrigerators or cool boxes.In any season devices like hairdryers and irons may be nearly impossible to run . For the fortunate few continuous cruisers who have miniature washing machines or air conditioners onboard low-wattage models are the way to go.Running a microwave for 10 minutes might take a narrowboats solar panels three hours to redraw according to Tim Davis of the company Onboard Solar.Onboard Solars systems are all designed to tilt 40 degrees in any direction . Being able to turn a panel toward the sun makes a big difference during times of the year when the sun is lower Mr Davis says.Even though the cost of solar power per watt has declined prices of solar installation have n't come down hugely because the capacity has increased says Mr Davis.At Onboard Solar PS1,650 would cover full installation of what he calls a  decent  solar power system three panels and 645 watts as long as the client already has suitable batteries.The main innovation hes seen in the narrowboat solar space is in the charge controller that acts as the idge between the panel and the battery . Recent generations of charge controllers have allowed for higher voltage and better performance under different conditions of light and shade.Solar technology that works in some shade is especially important for continuous cruisers in summer who face tough decisions between cooling off their stiflingly hot boats under tree cover and mooring in full sun to maximise energy generation.The Boat Time YouTubers have invested in a more efficient inverter which turns the direct current generated by their solar panels into the alternating current used by the grid.They also got new lithium batteries with much better storage to replace their old lead-acid batteries.While the battery upgrade was n't cheap and they had to buy a specific type with built-in heat pads so the batteries could be stored outside Miss Cross says that  it was night and day the difference that it made  .Mr Davis is hopeful for advancements in a different battery technology lead-carbon batteries which use gel rather than liquid . He says that the storage capacity is still limited but lead-carbon batteries are easier to recycle than lithium ones.More technology of business Yet even with all this careful rationing of electricity as well as fuel the narrowboat life is n't entirely clean.Fully electric canal boats remain rare and expensive and probably have to depend on backup diesel generators to power the engines . A fully electric boat could cost PS200,000 whereas a more traditional boat might be PS50,000.And orders at one electric boatbuilder are backed up for almost three years.Heat pumps for narrowboats are also uncommon.On weekdays in winter when their boat is stationary the Boat Time YouTubers idle their diesel engine for about an hour a day to supply enough electricity .  By the time I finish work its dark we ca n't really move anywhere  Mr Arthur explains .  So thats why we have to rely on idling the engine .  Engine idling is one of the activities thats restricted in an increasing number of eco-mooring zones in London.The capitals councils are also considering extending smoke control areas to canals to safeguard the health of boaters as well as other canal users.These areas permit the burning of only smokeless fuel or fuel in certain energy-efficient stoves . Traditional wood and coal the main heating sources for many boaters are not allowed.Such limits have caused controversy among Londons narrowboaters . A common argument is that life on a narrowboat is already more environmentally conscious than a land-based lifestyle.Another is that the costs and space requirements of upgrading energy systems put this out of reach of the average narrowboater.In one study of London boaters 91 of respondents reported that they lacked the capacity to electrify their heating and energy in line with the requirements of eco-mooring zones.At a local government level financial support to upgrade energy systems would help . So would increasing the number of connections to mains electricity along towpaths.For now a number of residents who live near canals complain about narrowboats stoves engines and generators creating pollution that hangs about close to ground level particularly affecting children.A carpenter whose own narrowboat is moored in a clump of four boats says that when one of his neighbours idles her older diesel engine the exhaust seeps right into his boat nearly choking him.The Boat Timers rely on a mix of heating sources . They do n't want to get caught out without heat especially since they share their boat with their pet rabbit and dog.They sometimes use their diesel radiators though a multi-fuel stove that burns wood and coal provides most of their heat .  Obviously a lot of those are n't the greenest fuels and we do sometimes get asked about that from people that hang around the canals and live in the houses  Mr Arthur comments .  Our fuel is basically coming from similar sources but because we are so aware because we have to manage it to such an extent I feel like we 're very economical with it  he continues .  We use a lot less than we ever would have done in the house .

The customers feel that they have been ripped off and that the burgers do not look like the ones shown in the advertising images. McDonald's is facing a lawsuit over allegations that its burger ads mislead customers about the size of the burgers. Disgruntled customers claim that the actual burgers they receive are smaller than what is shown in the advertisements. In a historic decision, the G20 has included the African Union in its discussions and decision-making process. This move aims to give African countries a voice in global economic matters and promote inclusive growth and development.|Why your burger may not always look like the advert|Y|Chris is a big burger fan . He 'll get one on the way home if its late . Or for dinner with the kids . Or sometimes just for a quick snack to fill a hole.Yet more than once he has found himself sending pictures of his dinner to friends and fellow burger-lovers so they can laugh over them . The difference between what is advertised and what comes over the counter just seems so huge .  Most of the time it looks like it has been sat on  he says.So when he heard Burger King customers in the US were taking the company to court it struck a chord .  You feel like you 've been ripped off  says the 42-year-old from south London who preferred not to give his surname .  But whos going to embarrass themselves by going back to complain You just swallow it .  Burger King has said the burgers it sells do not have to look  exactly like the picture  and that all the products featured in its advertising materials are  the same burgers served to guests all across the UK  . But diners sometimes feel the gulf between the image and what is served stretches credulity.Disgruntled customers cite other examples ice cream is shown with whole almonds but contains only shavings pizza toppings are meagre salads pricey but pitiful.Amy Wardle head of New York and Philadelphia-based food styling company Astir says theres a rule of thumb that pictures promoting food should not contain ingredients that are n't in the product itself.But that still leaves room for manoeuvre.If you are promoting ead you can put sponges between slices to give the sandwich a fuller look she says . To make a slice of pizza have the right  cheese pull  effect you might need to add extra cheese taken from several identical pizzas . Cereal can be pictured in a bowl of glue because that makes it less soggy than using milk.Burgers in advertising images says Ms Wardle often have  scaffolding  made of toothpicks to stop the bun sliding off the mayonnaise .  Its not that I 'm going to use something fake  says Ms Wardle .  But I am going to pick through dozens of buns to find that perfect top bun thats not wrinkled not torn .  I am going to take my little tiny scissors and make sure the edge of the bun is perfectly even so it does n't have crumbs hanging off little dangly bits from the slicing machine .   Then I 'll use the freshest lettuce that has no owning the perfect ruffle to it . I want the reddest tomato .  She agrees the online image of Burger Kings Whopper the burger thats at the centre of the US court case does make it look as though the meat patty is larger than the bun it sits on.Perhaps the burger you buy has suffered from being wrapped and left under a heat lamp with the result that the bun is a bit squashed she suggests.But its also possible the patty has been moved forward or that a particularly small bun was used making the meat appear  more abundant  .In theory the stylist could even have made a cut in the back of the patty and spread it horizontally says Ms Wardle.There is no specific rule against using these techniques in the US says Mark Bartholomew professor of law at the University at Buffalo in New York as long the image does not amount to a misrepresentation of the product.But there is a loophole he explains . Customers are expected to be smart enough to recognise that ads will often contain a certain amount of  puffery  .  The key here is was anybody actually fooled when they parted with their money  he says .  Did anyone actually think they were getting the TV version of the Whopper  In the US case in Florida Burger King could argue that no-one really expects their burger to look like the one on the poster he suggests.Already the judge has dismissed the claims regarding Burger Kings advertising images only allowing the claims about in-store images to be heard points out Prof Bartholomew . While we know advertising can contain hype and exaggeration the thinking goes images at the point-of-sale are closer to being part of a contract you see it you order it so that is what will be argued over in court.But Prof Bartholomew says so far cases based around allegedly misleading images have rarely succeeded because they are so subjective.And the US Federal Trade Commission almost never steps in on these kinds of cases.In the UK the regulations are a bit tighter although the underlying principle is the same promotional images must not be misleading.The Advertising Standards Authority ASA is responsible for policing promotional images except those in stores and on menus says its spokesman Toby King . If questions are raised it is up to firms to provide evidence that their images show the genuine product .  We know consumers are savvy . They understand ads are not reality . But there is a line . Our job is to decide when that line has been crossed  Mr King says.The ASA has banned images in the past including a KFC ad in 2005 . The ASA sent staff out to buy the Mini Fillet chicken burgers so they could see for themselves how big they really were .  In this case KFC suggested it was that the model had small hands  says Mr King . In 2010 a Burger King advert was banned again over size issues .  If we think theres misrepresentation going on thats when we ban the ad  he says.Chris in south London is n't going to stop buying burgers . But he would rather companies used publicity photos that were more honest .  A burger is n't even meant to look like that like they 're in antigravity  he says .  They should be proud of their actual product .

A public consultation will be launched by the Department for Business and Trade to address this issue, which is estimated to cost consumers ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ£1.6 billion annually. The practice of hidden fees is widespread across various industries, including airlines, transport providers, entertainment, and hospitality. Separate consultations have been launched to address the issues of fake reviews and confusing labels. The government aims to ensure that consumers have the clearest and most accurate information upfront before making a purchase. These consultations are part of the efforts to provide a crucial safety net for consumers and their cash while minimizing unnecessary burdens for businesses. Ancillary services, such as food and drink or cabin baggage, have become a significant part of airlines' business models, generating $103 billion globally in 2022. Airlines argue that unbundling these extras from the ticket price provides travelers with more choice and cheaper fares overall. However, there is a need for more clarity about final prices to benefit customers, especially in the context of the cost-of-living crisis.|Airlines could face crackdown on hidden fees|Y|Airlines could face a crackdown on hidden fees as part of a new government plan to improve transparency for people shopping online.A public consultation will look at ways to clamp down on firms that add necessary charges at checkout bumping up the final price.Airlines UK said the industry already delivers excellent value to consumers.It comes as new government research suggests the practice is  widespread  across a range of industries.In total this costs consumers PS1.6bn a year the research said.The consultation which is being launched by the Department for Business and Trade on Monday will last for six weeks.Airlines now offer a plethora of extras at the booking stage from speedy boarding and checking cabin bags to seat selection which often come at a price.The government said so-called  drip pricing  where the price paid at checkout is higher than originally advertised due to extra but necessary fees occurs in products ranging from ticket fares to food deliveries.Almost three-quarters of transport providers including air and rail include hidden fees in their products the research showed.The practice also occurs in 54 of providers in the entertainment industry and 56 of hospitality firms.Fake reviews and confusing labels are also being targeted in separate new consultations launched on Monday.Business Minister Kevin Hollinrake said the new proposals would ensure people have  the clearest and most accurate information upfront  before making a purchase .  From the shelves of supermarkets to digital trolleys modern-day shopping provides a great wealth of choice . But fake reviews and hidden fees can make those choices increasingly confusing and leaves customers unsure about what product is right for them .  We 'll be listening to industry to ensure these new regulations work for businesses too and do n't generate unnecessary burdens while at the same time providing a crucial safety net for consumers and their cash .  As well as extra charges when you book there may also be unexpected charges at the airport if you do n't follow a carriers terms and conditions.One elderly couple found this out last month . Ruth and Peter Jaffe from Ealing went viral after Ryanair charged them PS110 to check in and print their tickets at the airport after they had mistakenly downloaded their return tickets.So-called  ancillary  services have become a major part of airlines business models generating some $ 103bn PS81bn globally last year up from $ 40bn in 2013.Airlines argue that by  unbundling  extras such as food and drink or cabin baggage from the ticket price travellers get more choice and cheaper fares overall.But Susannah Streeter head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown said many customers would benefit from more clarity about final prices .  The deepening cost-of-living crisis due to high interest rates may make passengers more sensitive to add-on costs  she said .  The public consultation is hugely welcome and is bound to shine the light on just how tough some companies have been about enforcing their rules .  Trade body Airlines UK said  Delivering value for consumers is at the heart of an airline business with the competitiveness of the industry meaning it already delivers excellent choice service and value to consumers .  UK airlines look forward to responding to the consultation published today .  Articles sharing tips on avoiding costly extras are now common online . One strategy is wearing additional layers of clothes to avoid an extra baggage fee with one woman from the Philippines claiming to have worn 2.5kg of clothing onto a flight in 2019 . John Grant senior analyst at OAG an aviation data firm advises travellers to buy all their extras in one go upfront to minimise additional costs .  Buy for what you expect to use when you buy your ticket buy the bundle rather than keep going back as that is more expensive.  Which advises travellers to take hand luggage only if they can as it will often work out cheaper and to measure the size of their cabin bag to avoid unexpected fees at the airport . It also says travellers should make the most of their hand luggage by folding and rolling clothes to maximise space swapping bulky items like books and electric toothushes for e-readers and handheld ushes and planning your holiday wardrobe carefully so you do n't take unnecessary clothing.Finally travellers should consider booking directly with the airline Which suggests as they wo n't jack up the price of extras like some online travel agents do .

China is Apple's third-largest market, accounting for 18% of its total revenue last year. The ban may also be imposed on workers at state-owned companies and government-backed agencies. Apple's stock market valuation has fallen by more than 6% or almost $200 billion in the past two days due to the reports of the Chinese government ban on iPhones. This decline in valuation reflects the impact of losing a significant market and potential sales in China, which is one of Apple's biggest markets.

Restrictions were also placed on other foreign-anded devices.iPhones were already banned in some agencies the paper says but its sources suggested this had now been widened.It has not been made clear how widely those instructions were disseminated through Chinese officialdom.The reports came ahead of the launch of the iPhone 15 which is expected to take place on 12 September.On Chinese social media some people who said they work for state-owned companies reported being told to stop using Apple devices by the end of September . One joked that they were poor and did not have the money to buy a new phone  What should I use for work  they wondered . China is one of Apples biggest markets and iPhones are produced in the country though recently Apple has increased production in India.There has been no official statement from the Chinese government in response to the reports.Apple did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.Apple has the worlds highest stock market valuation standing at close to $ 2.8 trillion.As well as Apple shares falling shares in some of its suppliers were also hit.Qualcomm the worlds biggest supplier of smartphone chips dropped by more than 7 on Thursday while shares in South Koreas SK Hynix were around 4 lower on Friday.Tensions between the US and China over technology have been rising steadily with both parties imposing restrictions.This year Washington along with its allies Japan and the Netherlands restricted Chinas access to some chip technology.China retaliated by restricting exports of two materials key to the semiconductor industry.Beijing is also reportedly preparing a new $ 40bn investment fund to boost its chip making industry .

The airports had previously found the reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) before extensive news coverage over its use.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66755272|US files landmark lawsuit against Google; Efforts to curb tech giants' power in the US face challenges; Tech giants face increasing scrutiny and legal battles|The US government has filed a landmark lawsuit against Google, accusing the company of unfairly cementing its position as the world's go-to search engine by paying billions of dollars to phone-makers and web browsers to be installed as the default option. Prosecutors argue that these deals gave Google a data advantage and blocked rivals from emerging, violating US competition laws. The trial is seen as a key test of whether the US government can rein in the tech industry. Efforts by Congress to write new rules tackling issues such as privacy and disinformation are facing challenges, and tech firms have won high-profile victories in cases challenging their responsibility for content on their platforms and their right to acquire other firms. This indicates a shift in the crackdown on tech giants that seemed imminent a few years ago. The outcome of the ongoing legal battles and trials will determine the future regulation of the tech industry. Tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are facing increasing scrutiny and legal battles. The US government's lawsuit against Google is considered a landmark case and a significant challenge to the way the tech industry operates. Other lawsuits and regulatory actions against tech giants, including Amazon and cases concerning Google's ad business and Facebook's acquisition of Instagram, are expected in the coming months.|Google trial US takes on tech giant in landmark case|Y|Just a few years ago a crackdown in the US to curb the might of Americas tech giants seemed at hand . Bosses from Apple Amazon Google and Facebook had been hauled before Congress and President Joe Biden was putting in place a slew of officials known for their tough-on-tech views.But efforts by Congress to write new rules tackling issues such as privacy and disinformation are all but dead and in the courts tech firms have won a series of high-profile victories in cases challenging their responsibility for content on their platforms and their right to buy up other firms . On Tuesday the next legal battle will begin a high-stakes trial that pits the government against Google.The company is accused of unfairly cementing its position as the worlds go-to search engine by paying billions of dollars to phone-makers like Apple and web owsers like Mozilla to be installed as the default option.Prosecutors contend the deals gave Google which handles some 90 of global search queries such a data advantage that it blocked rivals from emerging and violated US competition laws . The suit filed in the waning days of the Trump administration in 2020 is seen as a landmark case the most serious challenge to the way the tech industry operates in decades and a key test of whether the US government can prevail in its fight to rein in the industry.Sundar Pichai chief executive of Googles parent company Alphabet is expected to testify over the 10-week trial as are executives from Apple .  Its the anti-trust monopolisation trial of a generation  says Bill Baer visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former government attorney working on competition issues known as anti-trust in the US.Some analysts say the government has a strong case.They noted similarities with the 1998 suit against Microsoft which the courts later found maintained its monopoly over operating systems through illegal anti-competitive tactics like pre-installing Internet Explorer.If the government wins this case it could mean Google is no longer automatically installed as a search engine and perhaps other more significant changes.Analysts say that could open up the opportunity for rivals like Microsofts Bing or ChatGPT to gain users and data a critical change would leave consumers with more viable choices . But a government victory is no sure thing . Google has maintained that it provides a superior product and nothing but its stronger offering has prevented rivals from working out their own agreements . Matt Schruers president of the tech lobby the Computer Communications Industry Association says Google can persuasively liken its deals to negotiations between food-makers and supermarkets over where products are placed in stores agreements that have been examined by US courts and deemed legal . Mr Schruers says he expects it will also be difficult for the government to prove that consumers have been hurt the traditional standard by which illegal monopoly power has been judged in the US .  US anti-trust law does not protect competitors from their competition . It protects the competitive process in order to protect consumers  he says .  Here it seems like the government is picking winners and losers ... and courts have traditionally rejected that view .  In other recent US court tangles with tech firms such as the effort to block Microsofts acquisition of videogame-maker Activision Blizzard the government has gone down in defeat . That has led to blistering criticism from some quarters including some Republicans who have accused the Biden administration of squandering money on cases it is sure to lose .  Are you losing on purpose  Republican Congressman Kevin Kiley asked the head of the Federal Trade Commission which handled the Microsoft-Activision case at a hearing in July . Fellow Republican Jim Jordan called the agencys approach  intimidation followed by inaction  . FTC chair Lina Khan and Jonathan Kanter who heads anti-trust for the Department of Justice which is handling the Google case have defended their records pointing in part to wins in other industries . But they have also acknowledged that a tougher competition approach will mean losses in some cases . Rebecca Haw Allensworth a law professor at Vanderbilt University says she thinks regulators can claim progress even in cases they have lost .  I think its too early to say that they 're losing the fight  she says .  They 're winning some battles and losing some battles but the war is not over .  Later this month the FTC is widely expected to file a lawsuit against Amazon . Cases concerning Googles ad business and Facebooks purchase of Instagram are also on deck in the coming months . Google recently settled a lawsuit ought by US states over its app store . Regardless of how this wave of lawsuits is resolved the tech giants are being slowed by such battles says Viktor Mayer-SchPnberger professor of internet governance at Oxford University.But he warns that the US is fighting  the last war  as developments in artificial intelligence put the big platforms on the back foot . Nor does he see signs that such suits will address questions like control over data that are likely to play big roles determining the major players of tomorrow .  It does n't mean we should n't do it  he says referring to anti-monopoly cases .  But we should not hope that this will solve the problems of platform power .  Anti-monopoly campaigner Stacy Mitchell co-executive director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance says courts have been slow to change despite mounting public concern about big business and criticism of how they have judged competition disputes . But she sees the tide turning .  I 've been studying anti-trust issues for more than 15 years and I ca n't overstate how much things have changed  she says .  I actually think we 're going to win this  she says . But she admits  I ca n't tell you how long its going to take .

https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66639477|Netflix's plans to offer more gaming experiences; Netflix's collaboration with Ripstone Studios for The Queen's Gambit game; Netflix's bottom-up approach to game development|Netflix is slowly ramping up plans to offer more gaming experiences to subscribers, considering games as a key part of its proposition to stay relevant with audiences. Currently, mobile games tied to famous Netflix franchises like Stranger Things are available to play, with tests underway to explore their compatibility with TVs and computers. Netflix's low-key approach and focus on mobile games first is seen as a clever strategy to understand the gaming landscape and cater to gamers' preferences. Ripstone Studios, known for making chess games, became one of the first companies to partner with Netflix to develop a game based on the popular television series The Queen's Gambit. The collaboration is seen as a collaborative partnership rather than just a licensing agreement, with both companies sharing expertise. The aim is to design a game that is accessible to as many people as possible, even those who have never played a video game before, in order to broaden the popularity of gaming as a form of entertainment. Netflix's approach to game development is different from what has been seen before, focusing on mobile titles that are cheaper to make and have less financial risk compared to big console releases. However, the success of this approach will depend on impressing players and capturing their attention in a highly competitive gaming space. Netflix aims to ensure that it is doing things in the right way and is still in the early stages of its games journey.|Netflix Streamers expansion into gaming is 'natural extension|Y|Think of Netflix and a memorable television show or movie will likely pop into your mind . What did you most enjoy Squid Game Bridgerton Stranger Things maybe Soon the streaming service wants video games to be competing for a place on that list.Netflix says games are a key part of its proposition to stay relevant with audiences in years to come and is slowly ramping up plans to offer more gaming experiences to subscribers . Leanne Loombe vice president of external games at Netflix tells BBC News  Games are one of the biggest forms of entertainment out there today so it really is just a natural extension for Netflix to include them as part of the subscription .  The lines between the different ways we enjoy our entertainment are blurring . When you 're in that moment looking to sit and watch a movie or be more active and play a game we want to make sure we have something for you .  Our goal is to have a game on the service for everyone . Not focus on making one big experience but rather a selection of titles that members can choose to play .  Since November 2021 games have been available to play on the Netflix app but this development passed many users by . Loombe says the streaming service has deliberately not been  shouting from the rooftops  but instead taking their time to understand the market place first.So far whats being offered are mobile games with some tied to famous Netflix franchises like Stranger Things and others independent of the service like Reigns Three Kingdoms .Currently they 're only available to play on mobile devices although tests are under way to see how they could work on TVs and computers.This low-key approach is a sensible move according to games journalist Shay Thompson who explains the industry is  littered with the failed attempts  from legacy media ands to get into the world of gaming .  When other mainstream entertainment organisations have tried to enter the game space they 've really struggled  Thompson says .  I think its often down to companies fundamentally misunderstanding what it is about games as a form of entertainment that make them so compelling to players .  Amazon Games is an example of this they 've had titles like Lost Ark and and Crucible with big budgets but those titles lacked the creativity and uniqueness that we 've come to expect from the games space . Thats a significant reason why those titles have n't ended up making a serious impact .  Experiences such as this and tech giant Google who closed its Stadia console this year show how difficult it is to find a place in the games space for companies . Amazons games division may not yet be as successful as its Prime Video operation however we still expect to see more titles from them in future . The company is currently working on a the next iteration of the Tomb Raider franchise starring Lara Croft .  Focusing on the mobile games first is a clever strategy that could work in Netflix favour  says Thompson .  It looks as if they 're talking the time to understand the landscape and gamers . I know their reputation has been a bit shaky on the streaming side-recently but it certainly seems like they 're trying to work with the games space and not against it .  However giving gamers what they want not what a big organisations think they want will be the key to making this work . That is creativity and being unique .  In future Loombe says we can expect to see Netflix leverage its intellectual property even more .  Connecting shows movies and games together from our universes is what we 're trying to accomplish  she explains.In a trendy office space in central Liverpool thats exactly what the team at Ripstone Studios are trying to do . In amongst the exposed ick succulent plants and pop culture memorabilia littered on the desks are developers and programmers busy creating the next update for their first partnership with Netflix . The Queens Gambit is as you may have guessed a chess simulator based on the adventures of the television series main character Beth Harmon.The team won the contract to make the game after Jaime Brayshaw the creative executive sent Netflix an email out of the blue .  I asked them when will Netflix become the Netflix of games  he laughs.Ripstone who have a long history of making chess games became one of the first companies to partner with the streaming giant to work on their games offering . Brayshaw says the relationship is not just a licensing agreement but rather a  collaborative partnership  with both companies sharing expertise with each other . As well as offering more content to Netflix customers in an increasingly competitive market Brayshaw thinks their collaboration is a chance to help grow gaming as a form of entertainment as well  Netflix has an audience 238 million people now  he says .  Many of them will never have played a game before so we had to think about designing one that is accessible to as many people as possible even if they 've never played a video game .  Its exciting because it potentially allows more people to experience the joys of playing games and it could oaden the popularity of the medium .  Confident that this agreement is a  win-win  Brayshaw is n't worried about joining the long history of failed game and movie or television tie-ins .  Yes there are lots of bad examples from yesteryear with tie-ins that are bad but its usually because there are timelines involved  he argues .  Netflix has a more mature approach where the products do n't have to tie together at release so fewer compromises are needed .  The streamer will be keen to learn from the other big media organisations renowned for working in film television or tech who 've tried to cross the divide into the games space . Googles cloud gaming service Stadia was discontinued in January while Amazons games division has developed its own titles with mixed success . It is currently working on a new Lara Croft game but none of its releases so far have challenged the popularity of titles like Fortnite or Call of Duty . There were redundancies at the studio earlier this year . By focusing on mobile titles which are cheaper to make than big console releases there is less financial risk for Netflix . It is n't investing millions in one experience that has to compete with well established ands to be deemed a success . Should a project fail to reach lots of players the financial ramifications are not as significant . However the other side of the coin is that in such a competitive space if players are not impressed with what they 're seeing if they feel it lacks scope or ambition they will very quickly move on to something else . It can be difficult to regain an audience that has moved on to other games . This bottom-up approach is different to what we 've seen before and we wont be able to judge its success for some time . As Loombe reiterates  We 're very early in our games journey right now . When its such a big industry like games and theres already some fantastic titles out there in the market that players really love we just want to make sure we were doing things in the right way .

https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66668053|Anonymous Sudan takes X offline; Anonymous Sudan's motives and location; Anonymous Sudan's previous attacks|A hacking group called Anonymous Sudan launched a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on X, formerly known as Twitter, causing the platform to be offline for more than two hours in over a dozen countries. The hackers aimed to pressure Elon Musk into launching his Starlink service in Sudan. The attack flooded X's servers with traffic, using unsophisticated techniques for which the group is known. Anonymous Sudan, accused by some of being a Russian cyber-military unit, denied the allegations and shared evidence with the BBC that they are located in Sudan. The group aims to raise awareness about the civil war in Sudan and the poor state of the internet in the country. They claim to be a small group of Sudanese hackers with limited capabilities but good skills. Since emerging in January, Anonymous Sudan has successfully disrupted numerous organizations and government web services in France, Nigeria, Israel, and the US. They have recently targeted Kenya, accusing the government of meddling in Sudanese affairs. The group has attacked infrastructure to teach countries and rulers a lesson, but claims to have red lines to avoid harming innocent people.|Anonymous Sudan hacks X to put pressure on Elon Musk over Starlink|Y|A hacking group called Anonymous Sudan took X formerly known as Twitter offline in more than a dozen countries on Tuesday morning in an attempt to pressurise Elon Musk into launching his Starlink service in their country.X was down for more than two hours with thousands of users affected .  Make our message reach to Elon Musk 'Open Starlink in Sudan  the hackers posted on Telegram.X is the latest victim of the gang hacking to  benefit Sudan and Islam  .Over several weeks of private conversations with the group on the chat app Telegram the BBC spoke to the hackers about their methods and motives.One member of the group who calls himself Crush told the BBC that Tuesdays attack flooded Xs servers with huge amounts of traffic to take it offline the same blunt and relatively unsophisticated hacking techniques for which the gang is known.The outage-tracking site Downdetector said nearly 20,000 outage reports were logged by users in the US and the UK with a far higher number of people likely to have been affected.Another hacking group member Hofa said the so-called DDoS Distributed Denial of Service attack was aimed at raising awareness about the civil war in Sudan which is  making the internet very bad and it goes down quite often for us  . X has not publicly acknowledged the disruption caused and Mr Musk has not responded to questions to launch his satellite internet service in Sudan.Anonymous Sudan has been accused by many in the cyber-security world of being a Russian cyber-military unit in disguise and causing cyber-chaos for the Kremlin under the cover of a foreign hacktivist outfit.The theory stems from its online support for Russian President Vladimir Putin and an apparent alignment of motives with other hacking gangs in the country . But the criminal group has repeatedly denied it is Russian and for the first time shared evidence with the BBC that it is located in Sudan.Crush the groups main spokesperson and key member shared his live location on the Telegram app as proof.Crush and Hofa also sent pictures of their Sudanese passports and other screenshots suggesting they are in Sudan.These things can be faked with varying degrees of difficulty but after weeks of conversation with the BBC and cyber-security researcher Intel Cocktail there is nothing to suggest the hackers are lying .  Our long-term goal is to show the world that Sudanese people although with limited capabilities have very good skills in many different fields  said Crush.In June the gang posted a message of support for the Russian government to end an ongoing rebellion by the Wagner forces . However Crush explained that  a similar thing happened to our country and Russians stood with us so we wanted to pay them back  referring to Russias support for the Sudanese government as it fights the ongoing civil war.He insists that their group is made up of a  small number  of Sudanese hackers who are launching the attacks from the country in spite of regular internet outages.Since it emerged in January Anonymous Sudan has successfully disrupted dozens of organisations and government web services in France Nigeria Israel and the US.For the past month the gang has attacked Kenya claiming the countrys government is  meddling in Sudanese affairs  . One attack heavily disrupted the countrys eCitizen portal used by the public to access more than 5,000 government services . When challenged about the impacts on citizens Crush defended the actions and said  The reason we hit infrastructure is to teach the country and its rulers a lesson and yes we have red lines that is if our attacks harm a lot of innocents .  However the group has also unsuccessfully attacked hospitals.The gang claims to be carrying out the criminal attacks to  defend the Truth Islam and Sudan  but on at least two occasions it has also tried to extort victims for Bitcoin.It has also targeted websites like OnlyFans Tumblr and Reddit saying that they promote what it calls  disgusting smuts and other LGBTQ+ things  .In June the hackers celeated when the US cyber-authority issued an official warning about a wave of attacks against American organisations which it warned  can cost an organisation time and money and may impose reputational costs while resources and services are inaccessible  .Its most high-profile attack in June disrupted Microsoft services including Outlook and OneDrive forcing the tech giant to issue a report with advice to customers on how to prevent being affected by the group .

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/05/covid-how-to-check-if-expired-tests-still-work-as-cases-rise.html|FDA extends expiration dates of at-home Covid tests; PCR tests become more expensive and less accessible; FDA extends expiration dates based on new data; Existing at-home tests detect new Covid variants|The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended the expiration dates of many popular at-home Covid test products, allowing some old kits to still be safe to use. The FDA advises checking the expiration information for each test on their website before using an expired test. Using expired tests increases the chance of inaccurate results, which could put people's health at risk. Lab PCR tests, the traditional way of detecting Covid, have become more expensive and less accessible for some Americans since the end of the public health emergency in May. This change in coverage by public and private insurers may leave some people unable to get at-home tests for free through their plans. However, certain local health clinics and community sites still offer at-home tests at no cost. The FDA extends expiration dates of at-home Covid tests when manufacturers provide data showing that the tests' shelf life is longer than initially known. The initial expiration dates were sometimes short due to limited data at the time of approval. With more data gathered over time, the stability and sensitivity of these tests can be assessed over longer periods. Existing at-home tests are capable of detecting Covid infections caused by new variants, including the dominant EG.5 strain and other currently circulating variants like omicron. The FDA and experts confirm that at-home tests, as well as tests conducted at medical institutions, hospitals, and other places, recognize these new variants. The FDA also states that existing tests and medications used to treat Covid-19 remain effective against the omicron subvariant BA.2.86.|Can you use expired Covid tests What to know as cases rise new variants emerge|Y|As Covid cases surge again in the U.S. Americans are digging out unused at-home tests that they stashed earlier on in the pandemic. Many of those tests may have passed their expiration dates but do n't throw them away just yet. The Food and Drug Administration has extended the expiration dates of many popular at-home test products which means some of your old kits may still be safe to use . You can check by visiting a page on the FDAs website that lists expiration information for each test and .  Thats the first thing I would do before using an expired test or throwing it away  Andrew Pekosz a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health told CNBC . If the date has not changed the FDA advises against using expired tests . Doing so increases the chance of an inaccurate test result which could put your or another persons health at risk. A false result carries more risk again as Covid gains a greater foothold nationwide primarily driven by newer variants of the virus like the now-dominant EG.5 strain or  Eris .  Covid hospitalizations jumped nearly 19 last week marking the sixth straight week of increasing admissions according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Public health experts say testing remains a critical tool for protection as Covid metrics climb . But lab PCR tests C/ the traditional way of detecting Covid C/ have become more expensive and less accessible for some Americans since the U.S. government ended the public health emergency in May. The end of that declaration also changed how public and private insurers cover at-home tests potentially leaving some people unable to get those tests for free through their plans . However certain local health clinics and community sites still offer at-home tests to the public at no cost. Before buying new at-home tests it would n't hurt to check if any expired ones sitting in your medicine cabinet are still safe to use . Heres a walkthrough for how to do that and everything else you need to know about these tests. The FDA website lists Covid test ands alphabetically in a table . Or you can use a search box to find your test directly. The agency indicates whether each and has an extended expiration date . It usually provides a link to a PDF with new expirations for specific test lots . Find your tests lot number C/ which is typically printed next to the expiration date on the packaging C/ and cross-reference it with the information on the PDF. For example a  BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Self Test  from lot number 181922 has a new expiration date of Oct. 11 . Thats more than a year after its printed date of Sept. 11 2022 extending the products total shelf life to 22 months . The FDA extends expiration dates when a manufacturer provides data showing that its tests shelf life is longer than what was known when the agency first approved the product .  Expiration dates that were initially marked on these tests were sometimes very short because they were based on the available data at the time  Pavitra Roychoudhury a professor of laboratory medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine told CNBC .  But time has passed and more data has been gathered so we can assess the stability and sensitivity of these tests over longer periods of time now .   The majority of at-home tests entered the market long before Eris and other new variants emerged in the U.S . But the FDA and experts say existing at-home tests detect Covid infections caused by those new strains most of which are descendants of omicron.  With EG.5 its very clear that at-home tests as well as many of the other tests that are done at medical institutions hospitals and other places all recognize that and other currently circulating variants right now  said Johns Hopkins Pekosz. Read CNBCs latest health coverage The FDA last week also said  existing tests used to detect and medications used to treat COVID-19 continue to be effective  with another omicron subvariant called BA.2.86 which has been detected in very small numbers across the U.S . The CDC is tracking that variant because it has a high number of mutations that distinguish it from any other known strain of the virus. So far there is no evidence that BA.2.86 causes more serious infections than other variants . But recent studies from researchers in China and Sweden suggest that BA.2.86 could be less contagious and less immune-evasive than feared.  Overall it does n't appear to be nearly as extreme a situation as the original emergence of Omicron  wrote Benjamin Murrell principal researcher of the Sweden study in a post on X formerly known as Twitter.|Food and Drug Administration|Healthcare|CNBC|Sep 05, 2023, 02:15 PM|The FDA has extended the expiration dates of popular at-home Covid test products, allowing some old kits to still be safe to use.

Its largest takeover was the $3 billion deal for Beats Electronics in 2014. Unlike Microsoft, which has acquired several companies for billions of dollars, mergers and acquisitions are not in Apple's DNA. For years, there has been speculation about Apple potentially buying Disney, a company with a market valuation of nearly $150 billion. The ties between the two companies are historically strong, with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs becoming Disney's largest individual shareholder after Disney acquired Pixar, owned by Jobs, for $7.4 billion in 2006. However, it is unclear if Apple would have any interest in buying Disney, as it has no core competency in running theme parks or selling consumer products like Disney does. Even if Apple were to consider buying Disney, merging the two distinct and well-established cultures could be a potential recipe for disaster. The Bob Chapek era at Disney has shown the difficulty of changing employee attitudes and expectations, even for someone with three decades of experience at the company. Large media mergers in the past have often resulted in value destruction, making the blending of Apple and Disney's cultures a challenging task.|Apple buying Disney would be a storybook ending for Iger but fairy tales are n't real|Y|In this article About 10 years ago I invented a rule about covering mergers and acquisitions that still has n't failed me . Here it is Will Apple buy insert company of your choice here -- No . Apple almost never buys name-and companies . Its largest takeover was 2014s $ 3 billion deal for Beats Electronics . Apple is strict about its culture and its focus . While Microsoft has acquired its way to increased scale C/ buying Activision Blizzard for $ 69 billion LinkedIn for $ 26 billion Nuance Communications for $ 20 billion and five other companies for more than $ 5 billion C/ M A is n't in Apples DNA . Read more Iger Chapek and the making of Disneys succession mess For years analysts and reporters have speculated Apple might want to buy Disney a company with a market valuation of nearly $ 150 billion . The ties between the two companies are historically strong . Apple co-founder Steve Jobs became Disneys largest individual shareholder after Disney acquired Pixar then owned by Jobs for $ 7.4 billion in 2006 . The deal also gave Jobs a seat on the Disney board and fostered a close friendship between Jobs and Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger . Apples market capitalization is near $ 3 trillion . Buying Disney would n't even classify as a bet-the-company transaction . In his 2019 autobiography  The Ride of a Lifetime  Iger acknowledged he believes Disney and Apple may have merged if Jobs who passed away in 2011 had lived longer .  I believe that if Steve were still alive we would have combined our companies or at least discussed the possibility very seriously  Iger wrote . Since his return as CEO in November Iger has kept Disneys connection with Jobs alive . A few months ago many Disney employees came to their offices to find copies of a book  Make Something Wonderful Steve Jobs in His Own Words  on their desks . Iger sent an email to all Disney employees touting the book describing it as  another tool from Steve C/ a resource for you the reader to spark the creativity that lives inside all of us .  Selling Disney to Apple could be a storybook ending for Iger who could argue the best way to transition Disney into a modern media company is to pair up with the most successful technology company in history . Disneys family-friendly and may be a fit with Apple which appeals to consumers around the world . Still its not clear Apple would have any interest in buying Disney . Beyond its treatment of M A as anathema Apple has no core competency running theme parks or selling the kinds of consumer products Disney offers . It almost certainly would n't want to be in the dying cable television business . While Apple has dabbled in owning sports rights and creating scripted content for Apple TV+ the businesses are so small relative to making and selling devices that they 're essentially non-material to the company . Apple has n't bothered to tell investors the number of Apple TV+ subscribers . On one hand buying Disney would supercharge those fledging businesses which could help with Apple device churn while growing subscription revenue . On the other if Apple wants to spend more than $ 100 billion on an acquisition getting an ESPN business with shrinking subscribers and a content business centered around streaming which currently loses money may not be its deal of choice . Apple could buy Disney to make content for its augmented reality headset potentially the companys next major growth division but thats probably not enough of a reason to make an acquisition . Even if Apple CEO Tim Cook fell in love with the notion of owning Disney and its associated perks free Disney World rides for Apple employees Content synergies for device owners its ambiguous at best and unlikely at worst whether regulators would allow a deal to proceed . With Lina Khan running the Federal Trade Commission which has tried to crack down on big tech acquisitions under her watch the chances of the U.S. government allowing Apple to increase its dominance over the global economy seem minute . Perhaps Apple and Disney could sue to win approval C/ the businesses do n't have much overlap C/ but the process would be time-consuming and messy inging unneeded uncertainty to both companies . For the sake of argument lets say Apple does want to buy Disney . Lets say Disney divests or sells its legacy cable assets ridding itself of no-growth businesses that would weigh on Apples earnings . Lets even say the regulatory environment changes so the U.S. government would be more amenable to a deal . An agreement would mean Disneys corporate culture would have to blend with Apples culture . The Bob Chapek era at Disney illustrated the strength of Disneys existing culture and showcased how changing employee attitudes and expectations is n't easy C/ even for someone who had spent three decades at the company . Merging the two distinct well-established cultures seems like a potential recipe for disaster . The overwhelming evidence on large media mergers C/ AOL buying Time Warner AT T buying Time Warner CBS and Viacom merging Discovery and WarnerMedia merging C/ is immense value destruction .

His hand-picked successor, Bob Chapek, took over the day-to-day operations of the company immediately. However, Iger remained as executive chairman for 22 months, retaining control of creative endeavors and movie and TV content. On November 20, 2022, Bob Iger came out of retirement to become Disney's CEO once again. The board had fired Bob Chapek, and Iger subsequently fired Chapek's closest advisors. Iger extended his contract through 2026, marking the fifth time he has delayed his departure as CEO. The relationship between Bob Iger and Bob Chapek became dysfunctional, leading to corporate dysfunction and succession gone wrong at Disney. Iger had chosen Chapek as his successor based on his integrity and business acumen, but their relationship followed a similar pattern to the meltdown between Eisner and Ovitz in the 1990s.|Disneys wildest ride Iger Chapek and the making of an epic succession mess|Y|In this article After pushing back his retirement four times Bob Iger finally made the leap . On Feb. 25 2020 he announced he would step down as Disneys CEO . His hand-picked successor Bob Chapek then Disneys parks chairman would take over the day-to-day job of running the company effective immediately . As part of the changing of the guard the Disney board suggested the new CEO should take over Igers expansive office at Disney headquarters in Burbank California . There was just one problem . Iger had no interest in moving out . He was n't truly leaving Disney anyway . His succession plan allowed him to stay on as executive chairman for 22 months . Chapek would report to him and the board . Iger would also  direct the companys creative endeavors  C/ nebulous phrasing suggesting he would retain control of movie and TV content and operations . There was a practical reason Iger did n't want to move out of his office . It had a private shower built for former CEO Michael Eisner and a vanity for shaving. Iger now 72 consistently woke up around 4:15 a.m. to work out and then shower . On evenings when Iger was heading out for a Disney premiere award show or benefit he would often take a second shower C/ this time in the office . Iger told Chapek that he lived for those  two-shower days  according to people familiar with the conversation . Iger chose Chapek now 64 as his successor because of Chapeks integrity and business acumen not his interest in Hollywood socialization . Chapek has the outward corporate demeanor of a Midwestern businessman C/ or as one colleague jokingly put it  a tuna salad sandwich who sits in front of spreadsheets .  Hes a risk-taker whos not afraid to upend the status quo but hes not a schmoozer by nature . Whereas Iger holds court around his Brentwood mansion C/ a short stroll from celeities producers super-agents and other Disney executives C/ Chapek lives about an hours drive from downtown Los Angeles in Westlake Village . Iger enjoys yachting Chapek is more of a power-boating and kayaking kind of guy. Both men agreed Chapek would n't have much need for the office shower  Chapek would instead move into a smaller office on the same floor. On the wall of Igers office bathroom hung two posters . The first was a framed collage of newspaper front pages and magazine covers with images of Iger celeating Disneys purchase of Marvel in 2009 . The $ 4 billion deal was arguably Igers shrewdest decision as CEO and one of the best media and entertainment acquisitions in U.S. corporate history . The second picture spoofed the movie poster for the 1975 Clint Eastwood thriller  The Eiger Sanction  but the image was of Iger instead of Eastwood with the title  The Iger Sanction .   The Eiger Sanction  is about an assassin who comes out of retirement for one last job . On Nov. 20 2022 Bob Iger came out of retirement to become Disneys CEO once again . The board had fired Chapek . Within days Iger fired Chapeks closest advisors including his former chief of staff Arthur Bochner his assistant Jackie Hart and his de facto second-in-command Kareem Daniel. In July Iger extended his contract through 2026 the fifth time he has pushed back his departure as CEO . Chapek confided to a friend that his tenure at Disney was  about three years of hell  defined by one overriding theme his unrelenting fear that Iger wanted his job back. Iger meanwhile has told peers and colleagues he returned to Disney to correct what he sees as one of the biggest mistakes of his career C/ choosing Chapek.  When the two people at the top of a company have a dysfunctional relationship theres no way that the rest of the company beneath them can be functional  Iger wrote in his autobiography  The Ride of a Lifetime .   Its like having two parents who fight all the time .  Iger was n't describing his relationship with Chapek C/ he was recalling his observations living through the meltdown between Eisner and his No . 2 Michael Ovitz in the 1990s . The pair got along great for years until they became the top two people at Disney . Within 16 months their relationship had exploded and Ovitz was fired. But like a son who vows never to repeat his fathers mistakes and then proceeds to do just that Igers relationship with Chapek followed a strikingly similar pattern . Theres no company in the world more associated with storytelling than Disney its most famous movies are modern versions of timeless fables . The story of the Chapek era is timeless in its own way . Its a tale of how good intentions clashed with huis and ego to erode one of the most famous organizations in the world C/ a case study in corporate dysfunction and succession gone wrong . As Iger and the Disney board resume their search for a successor a critical question looms Have they learned the moral of the story This account is based on conversations with more than 25 people who worked closely with Iger and Chapek at Disney between 2020 and 2022 . They declined to be named as the events and conversations were private . Many of the details have never been reported. Through a representative Chapek defended his record as Disney CEO in a statement to CNBC .  Bob is proud of the work he did in the course of his 30-year career at Disney particularly during his nearly three-year run as CEO steering the company through the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic and setting the course for business transformation as he and his team took the disruptive yet necessary steps for business revitalization and long-term growth  said a Chapek spokesperson . Iger declined to comment for this story . Igers decision to step down as CEO not only shocked the entertainment and media worlds it took even his close associates by surprise . Disneys head of streaming Kevin Mayer whom many outsiders had pegged as Igers likely replacement found out minutes before Igers public announcement .  I did n't know that was coming at all  Mayer told CNBC in 2021 . But Iger figured the timing was right . He was getting close to 70 and he 'd been CEO for almost 15 years . The companys recently launched streaming service Disney+ was an instant success . And Iger was convinced Chapek was the right caretaker to continue his legacy . Chapek grew up in Hammond Indiana  the son of a World War II veteran and a working mother  as he has described it . His family took annual trips to Walt Disney World when he was young seeding his genuine love for the companys theme parks . He studied microbiology at Indiana University and got his MBA from Michigan State University . He joined Disney in 1993 and by 2015 had risen to become chairman of the parks division. For more than two decades Chapek earned Igers respect as a shrewd cost-cutter and a low-drama manager . Iger especially valued Chapek for his integrity and operational expertise . At each of the divisions Chapek led at Disney C/ home video consumer products and parks C/ profit and revenue soared under his watch . He also benefited from some good timing running the home video division when Disney animation hits such as  The Little Mermaid   Aladdin  and  Beauty and the Beast  were first sold on VHS and piloting consumer products just as  Frozen  launched. Chapek cemented his reputation with Iger and the board during the construction of Shanghai Disney the $ 5.5 billion theme park that opened in 2016 after months of delays . Iger and Chapek traveled to Shanghai China together more than 10 times as Chapek got the cost overruns and construction headaches under control . His success helped Iger move on from former Chief Operating Officer Tom Staggs who was then in line to take the CEO job after Iger . Staggs left the company just before Shanghai Disney finally opened . It was Igers experience with Staggs C/ who did n't secure Disneys top job after being promoted to COO specifically to be Igers heir apparent C/ that made Iger decide Chapek should start as CEO immediately. He told board members he did n't think Chapek needed to audition for the role. Years later Iger would tell others he mistook Chapeks stellar operational track record for leadership skills . This was a striking admission for Iger who prides himself on his emotional intelligence . He is charming with co-workers and at ease with celeities C/ a Hollywood star in his own right . These traits paid dividends over the years . He convinced Steve Jobs to sell him Pixar cajoled Ike Perlmutter into selling him Marvel and persuaded George Lucas to sell him  Star Wars  and its bounty of associated intellectual property . In 2017 he struck a deal with Rupert Murdoch to buy most of Fox. Some Disney executives have privately speculated that Iger chose Chapek because he would n't rival him in either charisma or celeity C/ or more cynically because he was unlikely to eclipse Igers glittering record at the company. Whats clear is Iger did n't know Chapek as well as he should have . On a day-to-day basis Iger worked far more closely with Mayer and Staggs . Iger does n't mention Chapek once in his 2019 autobiography outside of the prologue C/ even though by then Chapek was at least tentatively in line to be Igers preferred successor. For comparison Iger spends more than five pages of his 236-page book discussing  Twin Peaks .  The entire process of naming a successor was bumpy . For a start Iger kept delaying his retirement In 2013 2014 and then twice in 2017 he renewed his contract after saying he intended to walk away . In 2017 according to people familiar with the matter Iger first told Chapek he was in the running to be his potential successor . The vetting process for CEO would begin with Chapek flying across the country to meet one-on-one with board members C/ not unlike contestants hometown dates on Disneys hit reality show  The Bachelor .  Iger had gone through a similar process taking 15 meetings with directors before securing the CEO position in 2005 . But Chapek never did the meetings . Iger agreed to buy the majority of Foxs assets in a $ 71 billion deal and renewed his contract as a condition of the purchase pushing back any talk of succession . In January 2020 Iger told Chapek the plan was back on . This time  Iger told him that instead of the one-on-one board interviews Disneys lead independent director  Susan Arnold would be in touch . Days later Arnold delivered the news to Chapek over lunch at The Rotunda Disneys executive dining room . She and Iger had both recommended Chapek for the job and the board had approved. Chapek sat on the secret for six weeks before the public announcement . In choosing Chapek Iger and the directors had passed over Mayer and Peter Rice then head of Disneys TV entertainment business . The board felt the leadership styles of both men were too ash according to people familiar with some of the directors thinking . Also Mayer had never run a business of scale and Rice had joined the company from Fox less than two years earlier . However Iger never consulted anyone who worked directly for Chapek in the runup to naming him CEO according to people familiar with the matter.  He had pegged Chapek as someone who would accept his somewhat unusual succession plan in which Chapek would serve both as CEO and CEO-in-training while Iger remained his boss and ran  creative endeavors  for 22 months as executive chairman.  Any of the big creative decisions that have to be made I fully intend for Bob Chapek to be at my side  Iger told CNBCs Julia Boorstin on the day of the announcement .  What this is about really is we believe a really good succession process and a really smart transition process .  WATCH Bob Iger steps down as Disney CEO and announces Bob Chapek will take his place Iger needed full buy-in from the board for his plan but that did not prove difficult . Over the past 15 years he had become the gold standard of legacy media and entertainment CEOs . From the time he 'd taken over at Disney to the end of Feuary 2020 Disneys share price increased about 420 far outpacing the S P 500 index which gained about 150 . By 2019 Iger had personally selected every member of the board which is surprisingly lacking in media and entertainment experience . Iger is personally close with several of them including Nike Executive Chairman Mark Parker and General Motors CEO Mary Barra. In addition the wife of another director Michael Froman then vice chairman of Mastercard and now president of the Council on Foreign Relations had been housemates with Igers wife Willow Bay at the University of Pennsylvania . It was from Parker that Iger got the idea for his succession plan according to people familiar with the matter . In October 2019 Parker who was then CEO of Nike announced he would remain as executive chairman of Nike while passing the torch to John Donahoe . That structure also happened to be nearly identical to one that Igers predecessor Eisner tried and failed to secure for himself . In 2004 Eisner floated a plan in which he would step down but remain as chairman while Iger would take over as CEO. But unlike Iger Eisner had lost his grip on the board . Directors Roy Disney a nephew of Walt Disney and Stanley Gold resigned their seats and in a blistering letter objected to the notion of Eisner remaining as chairman .  His succession plan is for a company led by Michael Eisner and his obedient lieutenant Bob Iger to be handed over to ... Michael Eisner and Bob Iger  they wrote .  Any arrangement that permits Mr. Eisner to remain as Chairman after relinquishing his position as CEO is contrary to best governance practices .   Eisner relinquished his chairman role in March 2004 after 43 of Disney shareholders withheld their votes to reelect him to the board the year before . He resigned as CEO in September 2005 . Iger assumed leadership of the company without anyone hovering over his shoulder . This allowed him to move quickly on decisions that Eisner might not have agreed with such as buying Pixar . Iger describes the acquisition process at length in his autobiography . Chapek would n't have nearly the same degree of freedom. In  The Ride of a Lifetime  Iger recalls watching Eisner leave the Disney lot on his last day at the company  Its one of those moments I imagine when its hard to know who exactly you are without this attachment and title and role that has defined you for so long .   Just weeks after Iger announced his departure Chapek began to wonder if Iger had regrets according to people familiar with his thinking . Equally soon Iger started to think he 'd made a mistake. At first the signals were tiny . When Iger announced his departure to staff on Disneys Burbank studio lot he jokingly called himself  Big Bob  and Chapek  Little Bob  a light reminder to employees about who was still the boss . On March 10 2020 about two weeks after the handoff Chapek Iger Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy and a small handful of other Disney executives flew from Los Angeles to Raleigh North Carolina for Disneys annual meeting. At the front of the plane Iger and Chapek were going over logistics and fretting about coronavirus . Iger caught Chapek off guard with some news . Chapek not Iger would lead the question-and-answer portion of the meeting an annual ritual Iger called  stump the CEO .   During his 27 years at the company Chapek had only attended one annual meeting C/ as a guest in the audience. Since Chapeks background at Disney had been in parks consumer products and distribution he knew little about the inner workings of ABC ESPN or the movie studio . He 'd been given a large binder of background material by the investor relations team but now he had to be ready to answer questions on any topic which could range from Disneys stance on the environment to the future of ABC News. After a couple of hours of general preparation Chapek retreated to a private area in the back of the plane and closed the door to study . Iger was perplexed and expressed his confusion to McCarthy . He assumed the men would run through possible questions and answers throughout the flight . Iger walked to the back of the plane to see if Chapek needed help preparing .  Is n't it all in here  Chapek asked holding up the binder according to a person on the plane . The basics yes but not the nuances Iger replied . Chapek who prefers to learn by reading and memorizing material C/ and thought he 'd already spent the first hour or two prepping with Iger C/ said he 'd rather stay in back and study . The first question Chapek would receive was whether he thought there was bias within ABC News C/ a topic about which he knew little but had prepared for on the plane according to people familiar with the matter . Iger would later relay this fleeting exchange to friends as one of the first moments it occurred to him that he may have made a mistake . He had thought he was handing off the company to a collaborative leader who would work with him side by side for the next 22 months . Iger began to worry about whether Chapek had plans of his own. Chapeks first concerns that Iger might be having regrets came during the next days flight back to Los Angeles after a ief stop in Orlando for a Disney town hall . Coronavirus fears had billowed into a full-fledged panic . Chapek stayed up front with McCarthy and Iger who got on a call with California Gov . Gavin Newsom to discuss whether Disneyland should be shut down it would be by the morning of March 14. At some point amid the chaos McCarthy suggested to Chapek that they do their first weekly CEO-CFO meeting . They were around the third agenda point when Iger snapped . It was disrespectful to conduct this meeting right in front of him he complained curtly according to a person familiar with the exchange. It was rare for Iger to show Chapek a side of himself that was n't  Disney nice  C/ the term many executives use for a corporate culture that emphasizes kind and respectful interactions . Chapek and McCarthy quietly finished their meeting but Chapek told others after the flight he left with the distinct impression that Iger was having second thoughts about relinquishing the job he 'd held for 15 years. These dueling perceptions that manifested themselves on that March round-trip flight C/ Chapek as bumbling and isolated Iger as unwilling to give up control C/ would define the next 2 1/2  years . Just days later the two men had their first strategic disagreement . Chapek wanted to furlough about 100,000 parks employees after Disney World closed its gates . Iger advocated waiting for the governments Covid-19 relief act to kick in so the furloughed employees would have some government money to hold them over . Iger called then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer both Democrats to ask them how close the U.S. government was to passing the bill . Ten days they told him . Though it was n't a creative issue Iger overruled Chapek . Disney did n't furlough employees until April . Around the same time New York Times media columnist Ben Smith published a story about the pandemics disastrous impact on Disney . After  a few weeks of letting Mr. Chapek take charge  Smith wrote Iger had  effectively returned to running the company .  Iger did n't deny this .  A crisis of this magnitude and its impact on Disney would necessarily result in my actively helping Bob and the company contend with it particularly since I ran the company for 15 years  Iger said in an email to Smith . Chapek was furious . He called Iger and told him he did n't need a savior dropping a carefully placed expletive or two according to people with knowledge of the call . It was the first time in more than 20 years that Chapek and Iger had had a major argument . Iger would tell people no colleague had ever spoken to him like that before in his life. Chapek also complained to the Disney board about the story demanding to be given a seat immediately Disney had promised him one but had not set a date . Chapek did not want Iger and the board talking about him or his job status while he was n't there according to people familiar with his thinking . Three days after Smiths story ran Disney complied . Arnold privately had a strongly worded conversation with Iger about setting him up for success rather than undermining him according to people familiar with the conversation . Arnold declined to comment for this story . WATCH How Bob Iger returned as CEO Disneys succession saga The relationship only deteriorated from there . Iger began privately grumbling that Chapek was n't involving him in company decisions . He told colleagues that he felt like he was on a bus that the other passengers wanted him to drive but he could n't reach the steering wheel . He began to understand that Chapek was not going to be an  obedient lieutenant   as Roy Disney and Stanley Gold had once theorized Iger himself would be as Eisners chosen CEO . At the end of a June board meeting conducted via Zoom Disney directors asked Iger C/ but not Chapek C/ to stay on the call for a customary  executive session .  According to people familiar with this conversation Iger told the board his relationship with Chapek had soured and that Chapek was n't exhibiting proper leadership qualities . The pandemic was shaking Disney to its foundations and Iger believed Chapek should be working more closely with the man who had run the company for the last 15 years. After Iger left the call the board ought back Chapek and asked him if employees were aware of how bad things had gotten between the two men . Chapek said he did n't think so but he knew Iger had been complaining about him to Disney confidants and Hollywood executives and agents. Iger and Chapek never participated in a face-to-face mediation about their working relationship . The board never demanded it . Privately Arnold counseled Chapek to be patient something she 'd continue to do for months to come in a series of coaching sessions . Let Iger run creative she said . In 18 months Chapek would have control of everything . Until then do n't engage in turf wars . In less than four months Igers plan for a managed succession had gone up in flames. When Chapek took over Disney it was clear that Wall Street cared more about its streaming results than any other division of the business . Iger had already begun to reposition the company accordingly  We 're all in  he said when he unveiled Disney+ in April 2019 . It added more than 10 million paying subscribers in 24 hours. However Chapek saw two major problems with the streaming operation . First he believed there were too many people making decisions about what content was slated for Disney+ . Iger and Mayer had tasked this responsibility to Agnes Chu senior vice president of content and Ricky Strauss president of content and marketing for Disney+ . Both Chu and Strauss have since left Disney . Others wanted a say including Mayer Chu and Strausss boss as well as Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy and the heads of Walt Disney Television and Walt Disney Studios . Mayer told Chapek the structure was messy and needed fixing . Chapek ought a business school mentality to this challenge which naturally rubbed creative executives the wrong way . He often cited the concept of ARCI C/ which stands for  accountable responsible consulted and informed  C/ as a framework for ensuring clear decision-making structures . Chapek would often say  Whos got the A  C/ referring to accountability . With streaming the answer was n't clear . Second Chapek understood that streamed movies were still seen as less prestigious than those with a traditional theatrical release . The chair of Walt Disney Studios Alan Bergman and his direct reports were reluctant to give projected hits to Disney+ or Hulu . Actors and directors overwhelmingly still wanted a box-office release . Even during Covid Disney did n't abandon exclusive theatrical releases unlike WarnerMedia which put each of its 2021 films on HBO Max and in cinemas on the same dates. But box-office returns were n't driving investor sentiment C/ streaming was . And during the early months of Covid Disney had limited inventory because production on new TV series and movies had ground to a halt . Chapek wanted to put premium programming on Disney+ as soon as possible. His idea was to implement a  make-sell  model a phrase Chapek borrowed from Iger who had discussed it with former YouTube executive Robert Kyncl in 2018 . The idea was to create a clear division between people who make shows and movies and people who sell them . Studio heads and content division leaders would still choose which projects to greenlight but someone else would have the authority to ing needle-moving content to Disney+ or Hulu . Companies such as Netflix Amazon and Apple also separate distribution divisions from content creation and Chapek hoped that adopting a similar structure would move Disney away from its legacy media habits . Investors valued Netflix far higher than legacy media because of its growth profile if Chapek could get investors to view Disney as a technology company they might reward him with a share price multiple bump. To this end Chapek created a new group called Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution or DMED . To lead the division he chose Kareem Daniel then a 46-year-old executive who had worked closely with Chapek for years first as a Stanford MBA intern in home entertainment and later in both distribution and theme parks . The reorganization gave Daniel C/ and Chapek C/ veto power over movie and TV show budgets . Chapek had a series of meetings with Iger to discuss the restructure including conversations in Igers Brentwood house and walks around the neighborhood . Despite the unaddressed tensions between the two the conversations were cordial according to people familiar with their interactions. Iger did n't try to stop Chapeks plan but he also did n't give it his full endorsement . His opaque communication style frequently confused Chapek according to colleagues . Chapek could n't tell whether Igers questions were a passive-aggressive way to signal disapproval or a genuine attempt to get more information . Inside Disney many executives saw the reorganization as a way for Chapek to shift the power balance away from Igers base C/ TV and movie executives . Chapek had long felt that Disneys culture under both Iger and Eisner treated non-creative executives like him as second-class citizens according to people familiar with his thinking . But Daniel rankled many company leaders who thought he lacked the industry experience or humility for the job . Daniel was known for his intelligence but he was prone to harshly shooting down opinions with which he disagreed according to colleagues who worked with him . Chapek tried unsuccessfully to coach him to be more  Disney nice .   Daniel declined to comment for this story . As agents and major Hollywood players realized Daniel was Disneys new power oker his inexperience in the entertainment world surfaced in ways that embarrassed some colleagues . He 'd enlist several members of his communications team to help him navigate the red carpet at premieres causing some executives to chuckle about his self-importance . His team would also prepare documents advising him how to act during these events complete with talking points for impromptu conversations with celeities press or producers on the carpet . The DMED communications division eventually ballooned to more than 100 employees which some on the team felt was wildly excessive . Given DMEDs importance to the future of the company Chapek did n't intercede. Still some of Daniels colleagues felt veteran Disney executives were being unfairly dismissive of him . It was Daniels responsibility to set cost controls so irritating studio executives was practically a requirement of his job . Chapek adjudicated dozens of conflicts between Daniel and Bergman according to people familiar with the matter . Both men got used to walking away frustrated . Bergman declined to comment . Directors producers and actors panned the reorganization . In a town where relationships matter they did n't know Daniel . They wanted clarity on whether their movie would go straight to streaming or get a theatrical release and their usual contacts on the creative side could no longer give them straight answers. When it came to TV there was less resistance to the organizational changes because streaming was n't associated with inferior quality . While creative executives were cut off from important data they used to judge the performance of their shows in an era of declining oadcast ratings landing on a streaming service often increased the total audience and extended the lifetime of TV series . One exception was ESPN . Rights deals are the sports networks lifeblood and ESPN executives were used to hammering them out directly with leagues . After the reorganization ESPN executives lost their budget power and gained layers of bureaucracy . Chapek was trying to rearrange the company at a time when nearly all employees were working from home . Virtual meetings ballooned in size . Conversations became unwieldy . Junior executives from Daniels distribution team who were involved in meetings because ESPN+ was being sold alongside Hulu and Disney+ asked questions of league officials that exposed their lack of business knowledge. ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro was so demoralized he contemplated leaving the company according to a person familiar with the matter . Pitaro declined to comment. Throughout all this executives who had lost power under the new structure were frantically complaining to Iger who told them he did n't agree with the reorganization C/ an assessment Chapek heard only indirectly C/ but that there was little he could do . Many veteran Disney creative executives viewed the reorganization as an example of poor decision-making . Chapek loyalists saw it as a necessary change to modernize Disney which they felt was being sabotaged by petulant TV and movie executives with Igers tacit backing according to people who were directly involved in the reorganization . Around this time in late 2020 and into 2021 Disney executives throughout the company started to feel increasingly awkward about the Iger-Chapek relationship . McCarthy warned Chapek that Igers criticism was reaching an increasingly wide audience . McCarthy declined to comment for this story . Most tried to ignore the rift and just do what they were told. Zenia Mucha who had been Disneys head of communications since 2002 before Iger started as CEO took a more active approach . Reminding Chapek of his predecessors legacy and stature she urged him to portray a united front with Iger. But Chapek did n't trust Mucha who was so close to Iger that some at Disney referred to her as his second in command . Chapek felt she was Igers communications advocate and not his . Others close to Chapek felt Mucha was n't championing him as much as a communications head should be celeating a new CEO . Mucha argued the country was being ravaged by coronavirus and it was n't the right time for puff pieces in Hollywood trade magazines according to people familiar with the matter. Chapek felt he could n't fire Mucha with Iger still lurking as chairman according to people familiar with the matter . On the advice of the board who agreed that Chapek needed communications help Chapek began soliciting advice from external communications firm Brunswick Group in early 2021 C/ without informing Mucha . He hoped Brunswick could improve his image in Hollywood where he was growing increasingly unpopular with frustrated content creators and agents. Mucha declined to comment. The first half of 2021 was good for both Disney and Chapek . The share price was rising . Disney+ topped 100 million subscribers in March blowing away Netflixs gains throughout the year . The world was getting vaccinated and returning to theme parks. During a June board meeting in Hawaii at Disneys Aulani resort members heaped praise on Chapek according to people familiar with the proceedings . This time instead of asking Iger to stick around at the end for a private executive session they asked Chapek . It was a small gesture but one Chapek interpreted as the board viewing him as the true leader of the company according to people familiar with his mindset at the time . Chapek told colleagues he was finally feeling more comfortable in the job . More specifically Chapek felt as though Iger had lost his path to return. In hindsight it may have been the peak of Chapeks tenure . Only a month later Chapek found himself back on shaky ground. In March Chapek and Daniel had made the decision to launch  Black Widow  C/ a Marvel movie starring Scarlett Johansson C/ for a premium additional price on Disney+ and in theaters on the same day July 9 2021 . There was one hitch Johanssons contract stipulated that her compensation was based on an exclusive theatrical release for up to four months . Since her contract was negotiated before Covid this type of issue had n't arisen before . Her agent CAA partner Bryan Lourd spent months negotiating with Disney executives throughout the organization warning Bergman and Chapek that Johansson would sue for remuneration if they proceeded with their plan according to people familiar with the discussions. Chapek viewed Johanssons contract as a creative issue and therefore Igers territory . Iger had a long relationship with Lourd and knew Johansson . This was his arena . Iger however was n't involved in any of the conversations with Lourd who thought Iger would have quickly resolved the situation given the value he historically placed on creative relationships according to people familiar with the matter . Lourd declined to comment . If Chapek wanted to be CEO he should be CEO Iger reasoned . To Iger this was a clear business matter C/ a contract dispute C/ and not a  creative endeavor  according to people familiar with his thinking . By this time Chapek and Iger were barely speaking to each other . In July after multiple warnings from Lourd Johansson sued . Disneys lawyers walked through the companys options in a virtual meeting attended by about 20 executives including Iger and Chapek . Iger did n't speak but he felt the meeting was  amateur hour  C/ a meeting  run by children  C/ with far too many people weighing in on how the company should respond according to a person familiar with his thoughts. Iger and Chapek both signed off on an aggressive public statement that accused Johansson of  a callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the Covid-19 pandemic  and revealed her $ 20 million salary for the film . The clear implication was that she was only seeking more money out of greed . Mucha argued Disney needed to have a forceful response because the lawsuit specifically named Iger and Chapek as financial beneficiaries from a stronger Disney+ . Yet both Iger and Chapek disagreed with the tone of the statement according to people familiar with the matter . Neither one stopped its release because each believed the other should be in charge. Iger called Chapek and told him he should issue a public apology according to people familiar with the call . Chapek refused said the people . Iger never even considered apologizing according to people familiar with his thinking . Hollywood talent and agents largely blamed Chapek for the statement . Chapek suspected Mucha was pushing this narrative to the press . To defend himself Chapek solicited other members of the communications team to help him call reporters without informing Mucha . Disney settled the lawsuit in October 2021 . That November Iger threw himself a goodbye party at his Brentwood house . After 26 years he was finally leaving Disney . He invited about 70 guests including director Steven Spielberg famed sports oadcaster Al Michaels ABC oadcasting anchors David Muir Robin Roberts and Michael Strahan and many former and present Disney leaders . Iger reluctantly invited Chapek . When he found out Chapek had a speaking engagement at Walt Disney World set for that day he was relieved according to people familiar with his mindset at the time . He did n't want Chapek to attend C/ and the feeling was mutual . Chapeks first impulse was to decline . But he knew it would look terrible if he did n't attend so he canceled his plans in Orlando. At the party the tension between the two was palpable . Iger sat next to Spielberg while Chapek sat far away at the opposite table visibly miserable . It did not escape attendees that Iger thanked dozens of people in his speech C/ but not Chapek . It was humiliating but Chapek told friends he felt relieved the tension was out in the open. With Iger gone Chapek could finally run Disney his way . He moved into Igers larger office the one with the private bathroom C/ but he never actually used the shower as Iger predicted according to people familiar with the matter . Chapek turned to some executive housekeeping that Igers presence had prevented . He combined government relations with media communications naming former BP corporate affairs boss and onetime Defense Department press secretary Geoff Morrell as chief of corporate affairs . That decision effectively forced out Mucha as well as general counsel Alan Braverman whom Chapek viewed as a diehard Iger loyalist. Other veteran executives left to coincide with Igers departure . They included Alan Horn Disneys chief creative officer and chairman of Walt Disney Studios from 2012 to 2020 and Jayne Parker the head of human resources who had been at Disney for more than 30 years . Chapek also fired Rice the well-respected head of TV in June telling him that he was n't a cultural fit . Rice had been at Disney for about three years after coming to the company via Disneys acquisition of 21st Century Fox . To combat the outflow of institutional knowledge Chapek worked overtime to make sure he retained McCarthy the CFO . McCarthy who had joined Disney in 2000 and who was in her late 60s was a master of internal politics and had close ties to the board according to colleagues . Chapek jokingly offered McCarthy a lifetime contract after he found out she had bought a house in Montana a sign she was thinking about retiring according to people familiar with the matter. By this point Chapeks inner circle had shrunk to a handful of senior executives . He did n't trust most of the existing leadership largely because of their ties to Iger and primarily relied on Daniel Bochner later replaced by Claire Lee Chief Human Resources Officer Paul Richardson McCarthy and the new head of parks Josh D'Amaro.   Chapek did feel he had an ally in Arnold who had become the new board chair according to people familiar with his thoughts . Arnold represented the post-Iger power center of Disney and she was now also Chapeks boss . It was n't long though before she found herself in the center of a firestorm . A little more than a month into Chapeks tenure without Iger at the company Florida Gov . Ron DeSantis a Republican introduced the Parental Rights in Education Act C/ which critics called the  Do n't Say Gay  bill . The legislation would prohibit  classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity .   Disney is one of the largest taxpayers and employers in Florida and Chapek and Morrell were soon fielding media inquiries about the companys stance on the matter . And employees C/ particularly animators at Pixar and Disney Animation C/ wanted to know how the company planned to react . Iger tweeted his thoughts .  If passed this bill will put vulnerable young LGBTQ lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer people in jeopardy  he wrote . During Igers tenure as CEO and chairman he had freely pontificated about an array of causes including climate change diversity and abortion . In a series of virtual meetings after the killing of George Floyd Iger had told Disney employees that making their voices heard was the best way to ing about change according to people on the calls . Chapek wanted to chart a different path . Weeks before DeSantis introduced his planned legislation Morrell had outlined a new communications strategy to the board . He wanted Disney to stay out of political skirmishes entirely and instead signal its values through  three Cs  content culture and community organizations supported by Disney. Chapek and Morrell had assumed they 'd have months to explain their strategy internally . But Igers tweet dialed up the pressure on Chapek to say something . On March 7 2022 Chapek and Morrell put their new public relations strategy into action . They penned a memo to all staff approved by the board . It explained that the company would not take a public stance on the bill.  Arnold who is openly lesbian signed off on the statement but told Chapek that Disney should also sign a public letter by the Human Rights Campaign or HRC . The letter which had already existed for months compiled a list of U.S. companies generically  united in opposing the wave of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation .  Chapek intended to sign the HRC letter but did n't want to undercut the message of the initial statement . Morrell and Chapek agreed that doing so would conflict with the companys new strategy of staying away from external conflicts according to people familiar with their thinking . In the memo to staff Chapek wrote  Corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds . Instead they are often weaponized by one side or the other to further divide and inflame . Simply put they can be counterproductive and undermine more effective ways to achieve change .  The blowback was swift . Employees chastised Chapek with hashtags such as Disneydobetter and Disneysaygay . But Chapek and Morrell were convinced this was the right thing for the company . They did n't want Disney in a culture war with DeSantis with whom Chapek had a solid relationship at the time. They were also thinking about China according to people familiar with the matter . Disneys  Avengers Endgame  made an astounding $ 614 million at the Chinese box office in 2019 . Disney also owns billion-dollar theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong . Chapek and Morrell believed it would be far easier to avoid conflict with the Chinese government if Disney emaced a policy of not taking stances on social and political issues . Arnold told Chapek she 'd been bombarded by furious comments from the LGBTQ community and sensed Disneys and was at risk . Chapek would have to walk back the statement for the good of the company she said . Red-faced with anger Chapek laid into his communications team telling them he regretted putting out the statement if the board refused to back him according to people familiar with the matter . But Chapek was hardly operating from a position of strength . He did n't yet have an extension to his contract which was set to expire in Feuary 2023 . Thumbing his nose at Arnold would hardly be wise . Chapek scrambled for a new public response . He walked back his statement at Disneys annual meeting which happened to be just two days later .  I understand our original approach no matter how well intended did n't quite get the job done  Chapek said .  But we 're committed to support the community going forward .  Morrell who had already championed having community organizations lead the charge for Disneys social advocacy suggested the company donate money to an LGBTQ cause C/ but he was n't sure which one . He and Chapek landed on giving about $ 5 million to the HRC and signing the public letter . The HRC rejected the donation . Still unsatisfied Arnold told Chapek he needed to formally apologize C/ specifically to Disney employees .  You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down  Chapek wrote in a March 11 statement to employees that they penned together .  I am sorry .  The labored apology only did so much . On March 22 hundreds of Disney employees held a walkout to protest Chapeks handling of the situation . Chapek agreed to go on a listening tour throughout the company to answer any questions and address concerns. In a late March interview with CNNs Chris Wallace Iger had some veiled words for Chapek .  When you 're dealing with right and wrong or when you 're dealing with something that does have a profound effect on your business then I just think you have to do what is right and not worry about the potential backlash to it  Iger said . This was the second significant communications gaffe pinned on Chapek in less than a year . Chapek fired Morrell in April abandoning his plan to merge communications with government affairs . He replaced him with Kristina Schake who co-founded the American Foundation for Equal Rights an organization that led a legal challenge to restore marriage equality in California . Chapeks reputation within the company had been seriously damaged. As a new CEO he did n't have the clout or internal respect to easily bounce back from missteps . An apt juxtaposition is how Iger responded in 2019 after making an unintended insensitive joke at a senior management retreat in Orlando . At the biannual multiday gathering executives participated in athletic events such as softball horseback riding yoga and bowling . The games were frequently high-spirited . Former ESPN head John Skipper once ruptured his Achilles tendon playing volleyball at one of the events and was taken to the hospital . In fact that year Kareem Daniel hit a little dribbler down the first base line and ran full speed to beat out a hit . Chapek was playing first base and charged toward the ball . Daniel steamrolled over Chapek knocking the wind out of him according to people who were there . About an hour after the conclusion of the athletic activity with executives still buzzing over Daniel smashing into his boss Iger presented the  Tinkerbells  C/ spoof awards accompanied by some light roasting of the recipient . Iger showed a photo of Latondra Newton then Disneys chief diversity officer who is Black riding a white horse . Iger quipped  Now thats a horse of a different color  a colloquial phrase used to compare two very different things. He added that Newton was always working choosing to ride the white horse to focus on diversity when all the other horses were own . There was a collective groan . Iger quickly realized he 'd unintentionally ought the subject of race into a light awards dinner . After the ceremony he found Newton and apologized . He spoke with her for about an hour the next day too and called almost 20 Black executives who had been in the room that day to apologize . Iger called Arnold too to explain what happened .  Bob apologized to me afterwards and we had an honest and productive conversation  Newton said in a statement .  I forgave him . Bob has a long irrefutable track record as a champion for inclusion and we continue to enjoy a positive relationship today . I consider him a friend .  Word of Igers blunder spread quickly through the organization . But it was a sign of the influence Iger commanded within the company and his established track record championing diversity C/ including pushing to get the Marvel hit  Black Panther  made and personally mentoring Black executives C/ that the failed joke had little impact on his standing . The incident ended up being an example of how leaders who quickly and genuinely apologize can smooth over mistakes . Newton would stay at Disney for four more years leaving the company in June . The episode is also emblematic of the importance of a unified communications team . The comment never leaked to the media . Had Chapek made a similar error its doubtful executives board members and employees would have been so forgiving . The  Do n't Say Gay  debacle was hardly an ideal prelude to Chapeks contract renewal talks in the spring which were led by Arnold . But once again he did have good news to highlight . Disney had weathered the Covid pandemic . In the first quarter of 2022 Disneys parks experiences and products segment saw revenues more than double to $ 6.7 billion compared with the prior-year period . It was time to look to the future . Chapek outlined a bold vision to the board . He wanted to transform Disney into a modern media company with Disney+ a globally dominant streaming service . Disney research showed the main complaint among Disney+ users was its lack of general entertainment . Chapek intended to push Hulu and Disney+ together to give adults more options C/ a  hard bundle  he later called it. He also hoped to figure out a role for Disney in the metaverse and hired 50 employees to focus on  next generation storytelling  consciously avoiding the term  metaverse  to deter derision . Several Disney executives privately mocked the effort anyway given the vagueness surrounding the entire concept . They wondered if Chapek was trying too hard to distinguish himself from Iger according to people familiar with their thinking . Without Iger on the board Chapek also felt emboldened to rethink ESPN and Disneys other TV properties . In particular he wanted to consider spinning off or selling ABC and ESPN C/ a concept Iger had consistently dismissed but later floated in a July 2023 interview with CNBC . When Iger was chairman Chapek was so reluctant to oach the subject of selling legacy media assets that he 'd carefully massage the language in slide presentations to avoid annoying Iger according to people familiar with the matter . Chapek argued that ESPN under Disney could have a future as a standalone digital business unbundled from traditional pay TV C/  the hub of all streaming sports  as he and Pitaro put it . Chapek wanted fans to be able to watch any game on an ESPN app no matter who owned the rights . To make that happen Disney would need to strike partnership deals with both the leagues and competing services such as NBCUniversals Peacock Apple TV+ Amazon Prime Video and Paramount+ which may or may not have been feasible. Chapek was also starting to gain traction with the Hollywood community . He 'd okered peace on Johansson with Lourd and repaired that relationship . Dana Walden who replaced Rice to lead Disneys TV division invited Chapek to her house to meet A-list showrunners and directors . A majority decided Chapek deserved more time to implement his own vision and he received a relatively short contract extension until July 2025 . The message was clear We believe in you C/ as long as you keep delivering results . Chapek interpreted the contract renewal as a qualified victory according to people familiar with his thoughts at the time . He could n't help but view it in the lens of what it meant for Iger . On the one hand an extension until 2025 would certainly make Igers return less likely . On the other Chapek told colleagues he feared Iger might turn up the heat against him C/ especially now that Iger was no longer bound by any fiduciary duties as chairman. Iger spent the summer of 2022 vacationing in the South Pacific on his yacht working on his second book attending the funeral of former Capital Cities/ABC CEO Thomas Murphy a longtime mentor making some personal investments and taking meetings with venture capital firms and tech startups that wanted to enlist him as an advisor . In September he joined the board of venture capital firm Thrive Capital founded by Josh Kushner . Yet as Chapek suspected and feared Igers heart remained at Disney . One friend described Iger at that time as  bored out of his mind  though others noted he appeared to be enjoying retirement . Privately Iger continued to talk with past and present Disney executives about Chapek and the future of the company with several urging him to return to Disney according to people familiar with those conversations . In the first half of 2022 Disney was the worst performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average down nearly 40 as part of the  great Netflix correction .  Netflixs lack of subscriber growth in January combined with rising interest rates and the end of the pandemic had caused the market to revalue streaming companies . Suddenly simply growing Disney+ was n't enough reason for investors to pump up Disney shares . During the summer Iger reached out to Schake the new communications head to wish her luck in her role . In turn Schake invited him to dinner . They shared common acquaintances C/ specifically former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama . Iger and the Obamas are friends and Schake was Michelle Obamas former communications director . Fearing Chapek may interpret the meeting the wrong way Schake told both the board and Chapek about the meal . Chapek was perturbed according to people familiar with the matter . Schake was supposed to be his communications director and already she was dining with the enemy. Still although Chapek could n't shake his fear that Iger was plotting a return as CEO Iger both privately and publicly denied this . Earlier that year he told journalist Kara Swisher the notion was  ridiculous .   Things finally came to a head in the runup to Disneys fourth-quarter fiscal earnings report . By 2022 Chapek and CFO McCarthy had a reliable pattern for earnings preparation . Disney board meetings are highly choreographed and executive presentations are rehearsed ad nauseum . So along with other executives Chapek and McCarthy would rehearse presentations for weeks . Then when quarterly numbers were released publicly Chapek and McCarthy would quarterback a conference call and question-and-answer session for equity analysts . The pair would agree on all the numbers and divvy up topics for the Q A . There were no surprises . In late September Chapek and McCarthy prepped the board on what to expect for the upcoming November 2022 quarter . But this time McCarthy began going off script . Not only did she reference numbers and forecasts the two executives had n't discussed she bluntly told the board the quarters financials were on pace to be very bad according to people familiar with what was said at the meeting . McCarthy told the board that Disney earnings that quarter would fall dramatically short of Wall Streets consensus estimate of 55 cents per share . Quarterly revenue would be more than $ 1 billion lower than projected . The quarter would be the companys biggest miss relative to Wall Street consensus estimates in a decade she said. McCarthy attributed this grim outlook in part to the companys failure to alter its streaming strategy after the industrys revaluation triggered by Netflixs first-quarter lack of growth . Disney now needed to prioritize profitability McCarthy argued . She thought Daniel was overhiring in DMED and that Chapeks restructure had created duplications that needed to be addressed by layoffs C/ something Chapek would announce in November. Chapek was blindsided by McCarthys responses . He had no idea the numbers would compare so poorly with Street estimates . McCarthy had n't told him she would be sharing such a blunt assessment of the business according to people familiar with the matter .  How could this happen  asked board member Mark Parker according to people familiar with what was said during the meeting . Directors Safra Catz Oracles CEO and Derica W. Rice formerly president of CVS Caremark peppered Chapek with questions about Disneys forecasting techniques and how division heads shared finance information . Chapek struggled to answer and declined to blame anyone in the formal board meeting setting . In an executive session alone with the board Chapek argued that if anything was amiss it was McCarthys poor financial management . After all the division CFOs reported to her . McCarthy either was n't sharing the numbers with him or had n't grasped how bad earnings would be he said according to people familiar with the discussions . Chapek shared his frustration over McCarthys surprising diversion from the script with several of his colleagues . But he did n't express it to her directly other than telling her she 'd unnecessarily upset the board said people familiar with the interactions .  Besides Chapek did n't believe the results were as dire as McCarthy was painting them to be. He pointed out Disney+ was still adding customers at a torrid pace C/ 12.1 million that quarter . As long as the streaming service was on pace to meet its goal of 215 million to 245 million subscribers by the end of 2024 Chapek believed the company was in good shape. Disney ended that quarter with 164.2 million Disney+ subscribers .  Kareem Daniel says we 're killing it  he told several colleagues according to people familiar with the conversations . In the previous quarter Disney shares had risen 5 after the companys revenue and earnings exceeded analyst estimates . By Chapeks reasoning even if the fourth quarter was a disappointment it was still just one quarter. McCarthy told colleagues she hoped her honesty with the board would jar Chapek into realizing his rosy outlook of the business was n't based in reality . McCarthys relationship with Daniel and his teams finance leaders had oken down . McCarthy told colleagues DMED was supplying her with unreliable information constantly changing its forecast according to people familiar with the matter . Disneys 2022 management retreat in Orlando fell a few weeks before the November earnings call and members of the DMED and finance teams gathered to figure out a strategy . General counsel Horacio Gutierrez told colleagues that people were entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts. He half-invited half-forced McCarthy Daniel Schake direct-to-consumer CFO Justin Warooke head of investor relations Alexia Quadrani Bryan Castellani DMEDs executive vice president of finance and several others to hole up in a conference room for the bulk of the retreat . They missed most of the scheduled fun such as interacting with the animals at Animal Kingdom and getting to ride new theme park attractions without the lines according to people aware of the meetings . Chapek had phased out the mandatory athletic activity from the Iger era . Chapek attended only a few minutes of the first strategy session . He spent most of his time at the retreat participating in activities that would showcase his personable side to employees . By this time Chapek had grown a beard which colleagues told him he should keep because it  humanized  him . When several of the executives locked in the conference room found out Chapek was having fun including petting a hippopotamus their collective frustration with him grew according to people familiar with the matter . Coming out of the meetings Schake and Quadrani told Chapek the reaction to the quarter could be devastating . Chapek began referring to Schake Quadrani and McCarthy as  the mean girls  a reference to the 2004 Lindsay Lohan movie because he felt they were ganging up on him . Those who took a gloomy view of Disneys prospects he referred to as  Eeyores  a reference to Winnie the Poohs perpetually glum donkey friend according to people familiar with the conversations between Chapek and his staff.  On the day of the earnings call executives met at Disneys West 66th Street office in New York . The finance team advised Chapek to deliver a sober message acknowledging that the streaming divisions net operating losses were more than double that of the same period the previous year C/ while emphasizing that Disney was playing a long game and would ultimately emerge stronger. Chapek refused to strike an apologetic note . McCarthy in particular was appalled at how cavalier Chapek seemed about the state of the business according to people familiar with her thoughts at the time . She was particularly annoyed that instead of frankly addressing the results Chapek waxed on about the promising ticket sales for Disneylands  Oogie Boogie Bash  Halloween event. The day after the numbers were released Disneys share price dropped 13 far underperforming the oader market . The following days were n't kind to Chapek . Activist hedge fund Trian Partners led by founding partner Nelson Peltz took an $ 800 million stake in Disney worrying board members that he may try to take a board seat and oust current directors . Separately board member Catz privately told Chapek he was making a huge mistake releasing the animated movie  Strange World  which featured an openly gay character . Catz who was on former President Donald Trumps transition team told him the movie was too polarizing and not up to Disneys quality standards . She warned a poor performance would n't play well with the board . Catz declined to comment. But Chapek and other Disney studio executives knew they 'd have to release the movie . The last thing Disney needed was to anger the LGBTQ community again . Disney released the movie on Nov. 23 2022 . It was a giant flop losing Disney about $ 200 million. Chapeks failure to heed the warnings of the people around him irked many executives including some previously sympathetic to him . Walden Bergman and others spoke privately to Iger who advised them that if they wanted to make a CEO change they should speak to the board en masse. In a highly unusual move board members also set up discussions with Disney division heads who rarely speak to directors outside formal meetings . Schake McCarthy Gutierrez Walden Bergman and D'Amaro all told either Arnold Mark Parker or the entire board that they no longer supported Chapek as CEO according to people familiar with discussions . All declined to comment. The board decided Disney needed to make a CEO change . There was only one clear replacement . Walden and Bergman both live near Iger . On Nov. 12 each took a walk with him in the neighborhood and told him they 'd voiced their concerns to Arnold according to people familiar with the matter . Walden asked Iger if he 'd be open to returning . By this time several other past and present Disney executives had also urged Iger to come back . Iger told Walden he 'd consider it although he did n't tell his wife according to a person familiar with the matter . Early the next week according to people familiar with the matter Walden planned another walk with Iger for 3 p.m. on Nov. 19 . Shortly before their scheduled stroll Walden called to tell Iger she 'd never had any intention of taking that walk She had made the appointment to ensure he 'd be available for a call from Arnold who formally asked him to return . Walden declined to comment . Iger and Bay talked it over . She told him that if the board was asking him to come back he should say yes . The following day Disney shocked its employees and Wall Street yet again . The board had fired Chapek who was n't even allowed to send a goodbye email . Less than three years after he gave up his job Iger was once again the CEO of Disney . Around Christmas Schake Quadrani and McCarthy received presents from a colleague pink sweaters an homage to their  mean girl  history . Michael Eisner and Bob Iger have been two of Disneys most storied CEOs and there are some striking similarities between them . Neither wanted to leave the company . Both had trouble naming a successor. Eisner declined to comment for this story . After 21 years in the job Eisner lost his grip on the board and Disneys shareholder base . Disneys stock plummeted and Eisner resigned . That would once have seemed an unthinkable fate for Iger who is now in year 16. And yet Disney is arguably facing more problems than at any time in its history . The linear TV advertising market is collapsing as subscribers cancel cable TV by the millions each year . ABC has finished last among the major oadcast networks in prime-time ratings for the past two years . The collapse of cable is even worse for ESPN which derives most of its revenue from affiliate fees from pay TV distributors . Customers of Charter Communications the second-largest U.S. pay-TV provider after Comcast last week learned that all Disney-owned oadcast and cable networks were dropped from Charters Spectrum service amid a fight over programming fee increases . Attendance at Walt Disney World slipped this summer . In the past few months Disney has laid off 7,000 people . The company is paying down nearly $ 45 billion in debt C/ much of which stems from the 2019 acquisition of Fox which appears to have been a giant overpay by Iger and his strategy team . In August Disney shares closed at their lowest point since 2014. Since Iger returned as CEO in November shares have slumped more than 11 . The S P 500 is up more than 13 over the same period . Since returning Iger has undone Chapeks streaming reorganization fired McCarthy as CFO and put Bergman and Walden back in control of budget and distribution decisions for their content . But those moves have n't been and are unlikely to be a quick fix for the companys woes . Under Bergmans watch Disney has had a string of movie failures . This year the live-action  The Little Mermaid   Indiana Jones and the Dial Of Destiny  and  Haunted Mansion  have disappointed at the box office . The Hollywood Reporter called the latter  one of the worst starts ever among Disneys live-action reimaginings of theme park attractions or classic animated films .   Meanwhile Disneys streaming division lost $ 512 million in the quarter ended July 1 . The company still aims to eak even on streaming by the end of 2024 . It has n't readjusted its target which was reset in August 2022 of having 215 million to 245 million Disney+ subscribers by the end of next year C/ 135 million to 165 million excluding India . Still one person who helped set those targets said  lightning would have to strike five times  for Disney to reach them . At the end of the most recent quarter Disney+ had 146.1 million subscribers C/ 105.7 million excluding India . Thats about 16 million fewer Disney+ customers than the company had on Oct. 1 2022 a sign that Disney has deprioritized adding streaming subscribers especially in India and that overall growth has slowed . Disney in August announced a 27 hike in the price of Disney+ to $ 13.99 per month in order to accelerate streaming profitability . In late July Atlantic Equities analyst Hamilton Faber pushed back his projected date for Disney to eak even in streaming to 2026 . Consensus analyst estimates call for Disney to end 2024 with about 50 million fewer Disney+ subscribers than the low end of its 2024 goal .  With Iger-led Disney raising Disney+ pricing to push toward profitability the Chapek era sub goals appear unattainable  said LightShed media analyst Rich Greenfield .  However with content engines all sputtering at the same time sub growth is the least of Disneys problems .  WATCH Disney CEO Bob Igers exclusive July 2023 CNBC interview During Chapeks tenure as CEO Disney lost more than a quarter of its market value . The pandemic clearly played a role in that . But Chapek should in his own words  take the A  C/ accountability C/ for some of his failures. Breaking with Iger was clearly not a sound strategy . Iger had nominated every member of the board built the company in its modern form and repeatedly struggled to walk away from the job . Had Chapek been able to better compartmentalize his insecurity over his job status its possible he could have okered a peace with his boss. But Iger must also take some blame for Disneys botched succession. Maybe Chapek was never the right person to run Disney C/ but Iger was the one who picked him . For the majority of Chapeks tenure as CEO Igers public and private attitude toward him wavered between neutrality and active disapproval . Right from the start he failed to champion the CEO he 'd chosen . If Iger consciously or not undermined Chapek at every turn thats on Iger too . Iger agrees he bears responsibility  according to people who know him . Thats part of why he returned to the job the people said . In July at a private panel at the Allen Co. conference in Sun Valley Idaho Iger told the crowd that he had failed to vet his successor properly and that he wo n't confuse operational track record for leadership again according to people in attendance . The entire episode has also revealed the limitations of  Disney nice .  Avoiding face-to-face conflict at least at the CEO and board level fostered an environment where Iger and Chapek could n't hash out their differences . Executives who openly challenged others C/ Mayer Rice McCarthy C/ were ultimately dinged for their frankness . Iger never went directly to Chapek with his concerns even though Iger was Chapeks boss . Chapek largely avoided inging up his fears with Iger rather than confronting the two mens issues. The systematic nature of the Disney board meetings did n't help . Directors have recently realized that meetings are dominated by unnecessary formality which has been a detriment to candid discussion according to people familiar with the matter . Board members have pushed for more free-form dialogue the people said . Succession planning is one of the few responsibilities that fall squarely on corporate boards . Turning Disney over to a CEO without giving him control of creative C/ the heart of the company C/ led to confused leadership and a near-inevitable power struggle . By skipping the one-on-one meetings with Chapek before appointing him the board did n't know how his personality would mesh with Igers if leadership clashes arose. So what happens now Iger does want to retire at the end of 2026 according to people familiar with his thinking and has said hes worked harder in the past nine months than at any time in his career . He does n't want his legacy to be marred by a failure to choose a worthy successor . Disney is likely to choose its new CEO around the beginning of 2025 according to a person familiar with the matter . Iger has begun vetting candidates already the person said . The board and Iger are considering processes in which Iger first names a chief operating officer as his heir apparent and sticks around as CEO or once again moves to an executive chairman role in 2025 to help with the transition . Either way this would leave a little less than two years for Iger to hand the reins to a new leader C/ about the same amount of time he had with Chapek . The job description for the CEO of Disney is one of the most complex in corporate America . The person who leads Disney must identify hit movies balance theme park pricing with attendance run a news division fuse intellectual property throughout the companys divisions sell consumer products tangle with governors understand sports media rights and make major acquisition decisions. A new CEO will also have to make difficult decisions about how to transition Disney into its next phase . Building new businesses at scale often leads to billions of dollars in losses before they become profitable . Its unclear whether Disney investors or the board would be willing to tolerate hemorrhaging cash . In 2019 Iger said Disney was  all in  on streaming but its unclear what that means today . There are no obvious choices within the company as Igers next successor . Walden Bergman and ESPN boss Pitaro have never run theme parks and have limited international experience . D'Amaro the parks chief has no media experience . Iger has built the entire company around him he may be the only person capable of running it in its current form . Disney could ing back Mayer and Staggs the duo Iger once passed over by acquiring their company Candle Media . But this would be a tacit acknowledgment by Iger that he made an error in judgment the first time . While Iger has relied on Mayer and Staggs for strategy advice in recent months he did not seek their input as a precursor for succession according to people familiar with his thinking. It might be easier to choose Disneys next CEO by simplifying the company . Iger suggested to CNBC in July he might be open to divesting the legacy cable networks and ABC . Disney could also decide to spin off ESPN . Advisors to Iger have pushed him in this direction for more than five years according to people familiar with the matter. Divesting assets may also make Disney easier to sell much as Rupert Murdoch sold the majority of Fox to Disney . More than a dozen past and present Disney executives said privately they believe Igers desired end game is to stay as CEO for as long as possible and then sell the company to Apple C/ Igers ties to the tech giant date back to his close personal relationship with co-founder Steve Jobs . But its less clear that regulators would allow a deal C/ or that Apple which has never acquired any company of significance would even want to buy Disney . Whatever materializes the contract extension Iger got in July likely means hes going to be Disneys CEO for years to come . For now internal candidates will do their best  Disney nice  to win over Iger and the board . And yet its entirely possible they 'll spend the bulk of their careers working and politicking and pining for a job they 'll never get. Just as it has since 2005 the magical world of Disney once again revolves around Iger . Everyone else is on his ride . The ride of a lifetime .

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/06/nfl-week-1-record-number-of-americans-to-bet-on-nfl-this-season-.html|Record number of Americans plan to wager on the NFL; Legalization of sports betting in the US; Expansion of sportsbooks and partnerships; Growing pains and suspensions related to gambling; Betting trends for the Super Bowl|According to a survey by the American Gaming Association, a record 73.5 million Americans plan to bet on the NFL this season, up from 46 million last year. The survey found that 19% of American adults plan to place a bet online or with a bookie, a 56% increase from the previous year. Self-identified NFL fans are expected to place more bets than ever, with a 42% increase from last year. The Supreme Court's decision in 2018 paved the way for states to legalize sports betting, and currently, it is legal in 34 states and Washington D.C. The growth of legal gambling and the ability to place wagers on phones has attracted a flood of users to major players like DraftKings, FanDuel, Caesars, and BetMGM. The NFL has embraced this change and signed five-year deals worth an estimated $1 billion combined with DraftKings, FanDuel, and Caesars to become the league's official sportsbook partners. Sportsbooks are now being integrated into stadiums, with the Washington Commanders, Arizona Cardinals, New York Giants, and Jets having physical sportsbooks either within or outside their venues. NFL owners have also voted to allow sportsbooks to operate on game days in states where sports betting is legal. The NFL has struck deals with companies like Aristocrat to allow NFL-branded slot machines in casinos and has partnered with FanDuel to offer fans $100 off the NFL's Sunday Ticket for placing a small wager. As the NFL adapts to the new normal for gambling, it has experienced growing pains. Player confusion over the league's betting rules has led to multiple suspensions, with at least 10 players being suspended for violating the NFL's gambling policy in the past two years. The league is working to address these issues and ensure clarity for players. According to BetMGM, the Kansas City Chiefs are the favorites to win the Super Bowl, and bettors are backing them to cover the point spread in the Week 1 opener. The most bet on teams to win the Super Bowl also include the Cincinnati Bengals, Philadelphia Eagles, Buffalo Bills, and Detroit Lions. Notably, one bettor placed a $100 bet on the Arizona Cardinals to win the Super Bowl, which would result in a $1 million win if successful.|A record 73 million Americans plan to bet on the NFL this season survey says|Y|As legalized sports gambling expands across the U.S. a record 73.5 million Americans plan to wager on the NFL this season according to the American Gaming Associations latest survey on Americans betting plans released Wednesday . Last year an estimated 46 million people bet on the NFL in the U.S. according to the AGA . The association said its survey found 19 of American adults plan to place a bet online at a casino or with a bookie this year up 56 from a year ago . Out of all U.S. adults 35.1 million people or 14 plan to bet online while 13.6 million or 5 plan to bet at a physical sportsbook . Self-identified NFL fans are expected to place more bets than ever this season with 37 projected to place a wager . Thats up 42 from last year . Sportsbooks anticipate a boon as the first NFL game of the season kicks off Thursday .  We expect this to be the most bet NFL season in BetMGMs history  Seamus Magee trading team lead at BetMGM told CNBC in an email . The NFL was once a staunch opponent of sports gambling . But the league changed its tune when the Supreme Court in 2018 paved the way for states to legalize sports betting . Sports betting is now legal in 34 states and Washington D.C . In four more states its legal but not yet operational . The growth of legal gambling and the ability for Americans to place wagers on their phones has ought a flood of users to major players like DraftKings FanDuel Caesars and BetMGM . The space has proven crowded for companies including with the entry of ESPN but has left leagues with no shortage of business partners . In 2021 the NFL signed five-year deals worth an estimated $ 1 billion combined with DraftKings FanDuel and Caesars to become the leagues official sportsbook partners . Then came sportsbooks at stadiums . The Washington Commanders have a physical sportsbook within their stadium . The Arizona Cardinals who hosted last years Super Bowl have one just outside their venue as do the New York Giants and Jets outside of their shared MetLife Stadium . NFL owners voted this year to allow sportsbooks to operate on game days in states where sports betting is legal starting with the coming season .

Thirty-one million people have watched Apples YouTube video from last years launch revealing that customers still like to get information directly from the company . This year the tech giant is hoping the new iPhones can bust a sales slump fend off renewed competition from Huawei and persuade owners of Android phones to switch . Apple also announced its new VR headset the Vision Pro in June ahead of a planned launch in 2024 . The company could provide an update on its efforts to attract developers but more details about that product are likely not to be released until next year . Apples Macs and iPads are unlikely to see new reveals on Tuesday given the company usually prefers to give them their own events . Last year Apple announced new iPads through a press release . This years launch invitations have the tagline  Wonderlust  although the taglines do n't necessarily preview what the company is announcing . CNBC will be covering the launch live from Apples headquarters and with a live blog on CNBC.com . Last year Apple announced new iPhones Apple Watches and updated AirPods at its September event .

This year the biggest change is expected to be a USB-C charging port replacing Apples proprietary Lightning port which was introduced in 2012 as the iPhone charger  for the next decade .  A USB-C charging port on iPhones will match the same charging port on Android phones newer laptops iPads wireless headphones and other gadgets . The change is being spurred by new European regulations which require a common charging port . Apple is unlikely to mention that the change was required by a new law but it will probably emphasize the positives for users such as convenience and faster charging . It might also give the port a proprietary Apple marketing name . New Pro models could also get a titanium casing replacing the stainless steel used in the past few models . Titanium is lighter than steel reducing the phones total weight . Event invitations show an Apple logo in what looks like a titanium finish . Lower-end phones C/ expected to be called simply iPhone 15 C/ could get an upgrade to what the company calls the  dynamic island  or a cutout that holds the phones facial recognition cameras toward the top of the screen . Last years Pro models ditched Apples  notch  for the undulating window which can show real-time updates such as how far away an Uber is or whats playing on the music app . The mute switch which has been present on iPhones for over a decade could gain new functions as a customizable  action button .  Apple is also likely to focus on camera and chip improvements as reasons for the upgrade . The biggest and most expensive iPhone model the bigger Pro could get a new lens that can zoom with twice the strength as the 3x zoom lens on the iPhone 14 Pro according to Bloomberg . One open question is whether Apple will raise price points . Some analysts think so noting rising costs for parts like memory or processors . However Apple did not raise U.S. iPhone prices last year under similar conditions . It does tweak its prices around the world regularly after launches and in response to currency fluctuations . Last year Apple released the Apple Watch Series 8 and a new high-end titanium model called the Ultra in September . Both are likely to get updates this year although Apples Watches do n't typically get as many major changes from year to year as the iPhones . Apples mainstream watches have had the same size and shape since 2018 . The company is likely to upgrade the chip inside the new watches as well as update its health sensors according to analysts . But Apple may save bigger changes for the devices 10th anniversary next year . Apple also has several accessories that use Lightning connectors such as some of its AirPod models Beats headphones mice and keyboards . AirPods Pro will get a new feature that does n't need new hardware called Adaptive Audio . It uses machine learning and software to intelligently turn down the volume and noise canceling so users can be aware of their immediate surroundings . Apple will likely update its accessories to work with USB-C but the updated accessories may not be discussed on Tuesday or could be released later . Even users who do n't plan to pick up a new iPhone or Watch will get new software for their devices . Apple previews its latest operating systems for its devices in June then releases them in September alongside new iPhones .

The company reported a net loss of $180 million, compared to a gain of $731 million in the year-ago period. One factor contributing to the loss was the company's settlement of the majority of claims related to the opioid crisis, resulting in a $1.4 billion charge. The slowdown in inflation has had mixed effects on retailers. While higher prices have contributed to overall sales, it has also led to a decline in the volume of merchandise sold. Kroger, which primarily sells groceries, has been less affected by the decline in discretionary merchandise. However, there is a risk that customers may turn to retailers known for lower food prices, such as Walmart, Aldi, or Dollar General. Kroger reaffirmed its full-year guidance but expects lower sales in the back half of the year. The company expects identical sales, excluding fuel, to range between 1% and 2%. However, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip stated that the company expects sales to be at the low end of the range and slightly negative in the second half of the year due to decelerating inflation and a tougher consumer backdrop. Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen mentioned that as inflation slows, the company is starting to see some volume improvement. He also noted that consumer packaged goods companies have become more willing to work with Kroger on pricing. The company has been catering to budget-minded customers with lower-priced items, personalized discounts, fuel rewards, and weekly specials. Kroger announced a deal to divest more than 400 stores and eight distribution centers to C S Wholesale Grocers as part of its effort to complete the merger with Albertsons. The approximately $1.9 billion deal will help Kroger stay on track to complete the merger early next year. The grocery merger is currently under scrutiny from antitrust officials in Washington D.C.|Slowing inflation is dragging on Kroger sales even as consumers still feel a pinch|Y|In this article Good news for consumers could be bad news for Kroger . As prices that shoppers pay for groceries stabilize or fall the supermarket operators sales are sagging . On Friday the company posted fiscal second-quarter sales that missed Wall Streets expectations . The company stuck with its full-year outlook but said the slowing rate of inflation will mean less revenue . Heres how the grocer did in the three-month period that ended Aug. 12 compared with what Wall Street was anticipating based on a survey of analysts by LSEG formerly known as Refinitiv The company posted a net loss of $ 180 million or 25 cents per share compared with a gain of $ 731 million or $ 1 per share in the year-ago period . One factor was the companys settlement of the majority of claims that it fueled the opioid crisis . The company agreed to pay $ 1.2 billion to U.S. states local governments and Native American tribes to settle the majority of claims that it fueled the epidemic . Its quarter included a $ 1.4 billion charge translating to a $ 1.54 loss per share for that settlement . Net sales fell from $ 34.64 billion in the year-ago period . For retailers inflation has been a mixed bag . On the one hand it has contributed to higher overall sales as shoppers pay more for many items that they buy . Yet it has hurt the volume of merchandise sold as customers think twice about buying C/ especially when it comes to adding discretionary purchases to their shopping carts . Target and Walmart in particular have spoken about customers buying food and essentials but less of the other stuff at their big-box stores . At Kroger locations the slowdown in discretionary merchandise has been less of a factor since everyday items like groceries dominate the shelves . But it has created risk that customers could turn to retailers known for lower food prices such as Walmart Aldi or Dollar General . Kroger is made up of about two dozen grocery chains including Fred Meyer Ralphs and King Soopers along with its namesake stores . Home Depot has also seen the strange dynamic play out as inflation cools . Lumber prices which shot up in price about two years ago have come down and made its overall sales look lower . Yet it has also felt the pinch from consumers buying fewer big-ticket items like appliances as they are forced to spend more for basics like food and housing . In the fiscal second quarter Krogers identical sales without fuel grew by 1 slightly lower than the 1.2 gain expected by analysts according to StreetAccount . The industry metric takes out factors like store openings and closures . Kroger reaffirmed its full-year guidance saying it expects identical sales excluding fuel to range between 1 and 2 . That includes the impact of ending an agreement with Express Scripts a pharmacy benefit management company . It said adjusted net earnings are expected to range between $ 4.45 and $ 4.60 per share including the benefit from having an extra week in the year . Even though Kroger did not change its outlook Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said the company expects identical sales will be at the low end of its annual range and slightly negative in the back half of the year when excluding fuel . In an earnings release he said the grocer expects inflation to  continue to decelerate  and expects a tougher backdrop for consumers in the months ahead . The prices that consumers pay for food at home are n't rising as much as they were before but were still up 3.6 year over year in July according to consumer price index data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . Compared to pre-pandemic food at home prices are up significantly C/ a jump of 25 when comparing January 2019 to July of this year . Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said on an earnings call that slowing inflation could lift sales in another way . He said as inflation slows the grocer is  beginning to see some volume improvement .  And he said consumer packaged goods companies have become more willing to work with Kroger on pricing to keep their sales going . McMullen added that the grocer has seen shoppers who feel squeezed by high inflation reduced government benefits and rising interest rates . He said the company has tried to cater to budget-minded customers with lower-priced items from its own ands personalized discounts fuel rewards and weekly specials . Some customers are buying smaller boxes of an item choosing the cheapest option on the shelf or putting less in their shopping carts he said .  We expect these oader economic headwinds to continue pressuring customer spending in the second half of the year  he said .  While the environment is difficult we are never satisfied with sales and we are focused on driving more units in the back half of the year .  Kroger put up strong online gains in the quarter with digital sales rising 12 year over year . It has expanded to new markets including Florida by opening giant warehouses to fulfill online orders . Kroger joined the list of retailers that cited organized retail crime as a factor thats hurting their businesses . On the companys earnings call Millerchip said shrink the industry term used for items lost because of damage stealing or other factors increased in the quarter because of theft . He said Kroger has stepped up security and added new tech to try to fight crime but said Kroger expects the theft trends  will continue to be a challenge for the remainder of the year .  The company is in the middle of an effort to close a deal to buy grocery rival Albertsons for $ 24.6 billion . On Friday Kroger announced the latest step to get the deal done . It said the combined companies have struck a deal to divest more than 400 stores and eight distribution centers to C S Wholesale Grocers a company that operates Grand Union and Piggly Wiggly grocery stores .

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/13/goldman-sachs-tech-ipo-market.html|Return of large tech IPOs; Goldman Sachs' role as key advisor; Challenges and doubts surrounding Arm's IPO|After a prolonged drought, large tech IPOs are making a comeback, which is a crucial moment for Goldman Sachs, the top advisor on Wall Street. Chip designer Arm is expected to begin trading this week, followed by delivery firm Instacart and marketing automation platform Klaviyo next week. The success of these IPOs will boost confidence in the market and help revive other parts of finance. Goldman Sachs plays a crucial role as a key advisor for the upcoming tech IPOs, including Instacart, Klaviyo, and Arm. As the lead-left advisor, Goldman's bankers drive decisions and coordinate with other banks, earning the largest portion of fees. The success or failure of these IPOs will have a significant impact on Goldman's reputation and performance. Arm's IPO, the largest listing of the year, faces challenges and doubts. There are concerns about the company's valuation, its exposure to China, and its ability to ride the artificial intelligence wave. Additionally, the small public float of Arm's stock raises questions about voting power and corporate governance. Despite high demand, some experts advise investors to avoid this IPO.|Goldman Sachs is in the spotlight as tech firms Arm and Instacart test IPO market|Y|The return of large tech IPOs this week after a prolonged drought is n't just a test of investors appetite for risky new offerings  its a key moment for Wall Streets top advisor Goldman Sachs . Chip designer Arm is expected to begin trading Thursday in the years biggest listing . Delivery firm Instacart and marketing automation platform Klaviyo are expected to list as soon as next week . While they each operate in vastly different parts of the tech universe the companies have one important thing in common Goldman is a key advisor . The stakes are high for everyone involved . Last year was the slowest for American IPOs in three decades thanks to sharply higher interest rates rising geopolitical tensions and the hangover from 2021 listings that fared poorly . Successful IPOs from Arm and others will boost confidence for CEOs waiting on the sidelines and activity there would help revive other parts of finance including mergers and financing . That would be meaningful for Goldman which is more dependent on investment banking than rivals JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley . Amid the industrys slump Goldman has suffered the worst revenue decline this year among the six biggest U.S. banks and CEO David Solomon has contended with internal dissent and departures tied to strategic errors and his leadership style .  This is the core of the core of what Goldman Sachs does  Mike Mayo Wells Fargo banking analyst said in a phone interview .  Expectations are high and they 're likely to meet those expectations . Should they fall short there will be far more questions than anything we 've seen so far .  Goldman is lead-left advisor on Instacart and Klaviyo meaning their bankers drive decisions coordinate other banks and typically earn the biggest portion of fees . On Arm Goldman shares top billing with JPMorgan Barclays and Mizuho . Goldman also was named the deals allocation coordinator . But the sought-after title of lead advisor comes with added scrutiny if the deals flop . If shares of Arm or the other two IPOs fail to trade for a premium to the list price in coming weeks dark clouds could form over the nascent market rebound . For Goldman perceptions of a bungled process would feed doubts about the company under Solomon . Unlike the banks unfortunate foray into consumer finance Goldmans position atop Wall Streets league tables has n't budged . The bank has actually gained share in advisory and trading since Solomon took over in 2018 . But even in its traditional stronghold there is room for cracks . Goldman is being investigated for its role advising Silicon Valley Bank in the days before its collapse . Initial public offerings can be tricky transactions to navigate . Advisors need to properly gauge interest in shares and balance demands from clients while pricing shares so investors see upside . While Arms offering is reportedly seeing high demand there are nagging doubts about the companys valuation its large exposure to China and its ability to ride the artificial intelligence wave . The SoftBank-owned companys valuation has waxed and waned in recent weeks from as high as $ 70 billion initially to the roughly $ 55 billion that represents the top end of a target share price of $ 47 to $ 51 .  We believe investors should avoid this IPO as we see very limited upside ahead  David Trainer CEO of research firm New Constructs wrote Tuesday in a note .  SoftBank is wasting no time by offering Arm Holdings to the public markets and at a valuation that is completely disconnected from the companys fundamentals .  Further Arm is selling an unusually small slice of its overall stock about 9 which helps drive scarcity . That small public float means new investors will have fewer rights related to voting power and corporate governance Trainer noted . The IPO is expected to raise more than $ 5 billion for Arm and generate more than $ 100 million in fees for its bankers . There are more than 20 tech companies weighing whether to go public in the next year or so if conditions remain favorable according to bankers with knowledge of the market . While some have begun taking steps to list in the first half of 2024 according to the bankers the situation is fragile .

Farley blamed Fain for not showing up to the bargaining table and criticized the lack of genuine counteroffers from the union. Jim Farley expressed surprise that Shawn Fain, who is negotiating with General Motors and Stellantis, was absent during a meeting that he and Ford Chair Bill Ford expected Fain to attend. Farley questioned whether Fain is too busy planning strikes or PR events, which may hinder the negotiation process. The United Auto Workers (UAW) has demanded ambitious targets, including 40 hourly pay increases, a reduced 32-hour workweek, a shift back to traditional pensions, the elimination of compensation tiers, and a restoration of cost-of-living adjustments. Ford's most recent proposal included some of the union's demands, such as wage increases and benefits, but not all of them.|Ford CEO rebuffs UAW leaders criticisms as strike deadline on Thursday approaches|Y|In this article DETROIT  Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley rebuffed comments by United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain that the company is not taking bargaining seriously ahead of a Thursday night strike deadline placing blame on the union leader for not showing up to the bargaining table  both figuratively and literally . Farley said the company has received  no genuine counteroffer  on its four economic proposals including the latest offer that Ford is calling the most generous ever between the UAW and company . He also said Fain who is simultaneously negotiating with General Motors and Stellantis was absent during a Tuesday meeting that he and Ford Chair Bill Ford expected Fain to attend .  We 're here we 're ready to negotiate but its sure hard to negotiate a contract when theres no one to negotiate with  Farley told reporters Wednesday night on the sidelines of the Detroit Auto Show .  We have time left but its hard to negotiate when you do n't get any feedback back .  Farleys comments came roughly 24 hours after he told reporters Tuesday that he was optimistic the company could reach a deal with the union . Public criticism between the union and an automaker are n't unprecedented but the amount of detail being released announced strike plans and simultaneous bargaining certainly are . Farley said he did n't know Fain had received the offer until he was discussing it during a 5 p.m . ET Facebook Live with union members . He also questioned whether Fain is too busy already  planning strikes or PR events that we ca n't get the feedback to make the best offer .  A UAW spokesman did not immediately respond for comment regarding Farleys comments or a letter released on his behalf by the company countering many of Fains criticisms . The union has argued the companies know their demands . They include ambitious targets of 40 hourly pay increases a reduced 32-hour workweek a shift back to traditional pensions the elimination of compensation tiers and a restoration of cost-of-living adjustments among other items . Farley declined to directly answer a question about whether he believes the union is bargaining in good faith which could justify a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board . The UAW late last month filed unfair labor practice charges against GM and Stellantis to the NLRB for not bargaining with the union in good faith or a timely manner . It did not file a complaint against Ford . As released Wednesday by UAW Fords most recent proposal included some of the unions demands but not all of them . It included 20 wage increases a  deficient  restoration of cost-of-living adjustment reworked profit-sharing formula 90-day progression for  temp  or supplemental workers to become regular employees and other benefits such as increased vacation days and two-week paid parental leave . Fain said Ford and its crosstown rivals rejected the unions retiree and health-care proposals . If the UAW and the companies can not reach a deal by an 11:59 p.m . ET Thursday deadline Fain said the union will implement targeted strikes at certain plants against the Detroit automakers . During his Facebook event Fain said he believed strikes against the companies are  likely .   To win we 're likely going to have to take action . Just as we have approached our negotiations differently than we have in the past we 're preparing to strike these companies in a way they 've never seen before  Fain said . Here is the full text of Farleys letter following Fains remarks The Ford team continues to put 100 of our energy into reaching an agreement with the UAW that rewards our valued employees and allows the company to invest in the future . If there is a strike its not because Ford did n't make a great offer . We have and thats what we can control . In fact we have put four offers on the table starting Aug. 29 and each one has been increasingly generous . We still have not received any genuine counteroffer . On Tuesday Bill Ford and I sat down with the union at the main table for a major offer . As we were walking in the room we learned President Fain would not be attending . Nevertheless Bill and I laid out a historically generous offer to the UAW Ford bargaining team because we listened to the UAW demands and we care about our employees . Here are the facts . Ford C/ Significantly increased our proposal on wage increases C/ Offered Cost of Living Adjustments or COLA C/ Fully eliminated wage tiers so all employees can achieve industry-leading wages  and shortened to four from eight years the time it takes hourly employees to reach the top wage C/ Increased contributions to in-progression retirement savings C/ Protected health care benefits that would continue to rank in the top 1 of all employer sponsored medical plans for lowest employee cost sharing and C/ Added more paid time off with up to five weeks of vacation and 17 paid holidays each year with the addition of Juneteenth . The first we learned President Fain received the offer was on Facebook Live this evening . So again we are here and ready to reach a deal . We should be working creatively to solve hard problems rather than planning strikes and PR events . Please remember that Ford more than any other company has bet on the UAW and treated the UAW with respect . We have been incredibly supportive of the union . We have gone well beyond any contract language in adding jobs and investment . The future of our industry is at stake . Lets do everything we can to avert a disastrous outcome .

The offer includes significant pay increases, more vacation days, and better benefits for retirees. However, it falls short of the union's demand for a 40% pay increase over the four years of the deal. GM released details of its new offer just hours before the UAW's strike deadline. The UAW had the option to initiate targeted strikes against GM, Ford Motor, and Stellantis if deals were not reached by 11:59 p.m. ET on Thursday. The release of the offer puts pressure on the UAW to consider the proposal. Ford has warned about the potential financial impact of meeting the UAW's demands.

The proposal which GM CEO Mary Barra called  compelling and unprecedented  addresses many of the unions demands but continues to fall short on others such as a 40 pay increase over the four years of the deal that UAW sought . GM released details of the deal roughly nine hours before the UAW could initiate targeted strikes against GM Ford Motor and Stellantis if deals are not reached by 11:59 p.m . ET on Thursday .  We 're at a crossroads on our path to building a company that can sustain all of us for decades to come  Barra said in a public letter .  Today we put a compelling and unprecedented economic package on the table that reflects the significance of this critical moment .  GMs latest offer matches several provisions in a Ford proposal that the UAW made public last night . But it still falls short of the unions public demands in several key respects . The automakers were warning Thursday about the potential effects of meeting the UAWs terms . Ford sources said the automaker would have lost $ 14.4 billion over last four years if the current demands had been in effect instead of recording nearly $ 30 billion in profits . UAW President Shawn Fain seems determined to achieve those terms . The sources who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity due to the ongoing discussions also pushed back on the UAWs argument that members are n't making a living wage . They said the average compensation under Fords current proposal for first-year UAW employees would be $ 132,000 including $ 92,000 in cash and $ 17,500 in health care coverage . Here are the key pieces of the GM offer made Thursday  We are working with urgency and have proposed yet another increasingly strong offer with the goal of reaching an agreement tonight  Barra said in the letter .

https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/business/bmw-i7/index.html|BMW unveils the new i7 electric sedan; BMW emphasizes adaptable engineering for electric vehicles; BMW's new 7 Series offers luxury and advanced technology|BMW has unveiled the new i7, a battery-powered version of its flagship 7 Series sedan. The i7 has a starting price of $119,300 and offers a range of 300 miles on a full charge. It is part of BMW's flexible electric vehicle strategy, which allows the company to produce both electric and gas-powered cars on the same assembly lines. Unlike its luxury competitors, BMW focuses on adaptable engineering for its electric vehicles. All of BMW's new models are designed to be built with internal combustion engines, fully electric power, or as plug-in hybrids. This approach gives BMW the flexibility to produce more or fewer electric cars or gas-powered cars based on market demand. The new BMW 7 Series sedan offers a superior full-size luxury experience, regardless of its power source. It features excellent driving experience, interior comfort, and advanced technology. The back seats are spacious and can recline, while front seat occupants can enjoy a high-resolution video screen and streaming videos when the car is parked.|BMW reveals its new $ 120,000 electric flagship|Y|Electric vehicles with their need for lots of expensive batteries have often trended towards luxury . Electric cars from Porsche Mercedes and Audi have all hit the market in recent years . BMW has come out with its own electric cars like the iX and i4 and now the new i7 a battery-powered take on the ands new most expensive sedan . While BMW is probably better known for its smaller 3 Series and 4 Series cars the 7 Series is the ands showpiece for luxury and technology . The i7 is the electric version of a new generation of the BMW 7 Series flagship unveiled on Wednesday . With a starting price of $ 119,300 the all-wheel-drive 536 horsepower i7 xDrive60 will be able to go 300 miles on a full charge which is less than the competing Mercedes EQS or Lucid Air . It will also offer a V8-powered gasoline version the 760i X-drive with the same horsepower output and a starting price thats $ 300 less . It will look almost identical . A gas-powered version with a 6-cylinder engine will have a starting price of $ 93,300 . This new version also highlights BMWs flexibility-first electric vehicle strategy which is different from that of luxury competitors like Mercedes-Benz and Audi . While those other luxury ands electric vehicles are based on dedicated EV chassis with little relationship to their gas-powered models BMW emphasizes adaptable engineering as its edge . BMW has engineered all its new models so they can be built with internal combustion engines fully electric power or as plug-in hyids that combine both electric and gas power . BMW executives insist this is not just a matter of fitting batteries and electric motors into cars that were intended to have gas engines . Instead these vehicles have been designed from the outset to be built with any of these drive systems . A major benefit of doing it this way BMW executives say is that it gives the companyflexibility to easily produce more  or fewer  electric cars or gas-powered cars on the same assembly lines rather than having to commit manufacturing resources just to EVs . With cars and SUVs designed to be built as either the car maker also doesnt risk putting millions of dollars of development costs into an electric-only model that might find little demand in some markets . Another benefit BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said is that customers neednt choose between two completely different models when deciding whether they want an electric or gas-powered car . They can just decide they want to buy a BMW 7 Series then choose whether they want the gasoline or electric version just as they might decide whether they want a V8 or a straight-6 engine . Either way customers get the same luxury car experience and design . The downside of a common engineering platform is that to enable both electric and gasoline power designers need compromises . Cars with internal combustion engines need a large amount of free space up front for the engine a smaller one typically under the trunk for the fuel tank and often a long tunnel down the middle to connect the engine to the wheels . Electric cars on the other hand can have smaller electric motors mounted closer to individual wheels and while they dont have a fuel tank or a transmission tunnel they need a large relatively flat area typically on the bottom of the car for the batteries . The Mercedes EQS electric sedan for example has only a short hood that houses some electronic components and it has a nearly flat floor allowing more interior storage space . Zipse insisted the 7 Series represents a superior full-size luxury sedan regardless of its power source . The driving experience will be excellent he said as will interior comfort and technology . There is no car with a more spacious luxurious second row  he said during a meeting with journalists . Back seats are a major reason for buying this sort of large car . In full-size sedans there generally isnt much more room if any in the front seats compared to smaller cars . The extra space usually goes to those in the back . As in many other high-end large cars the back seats can recline while leg and foot rests rise from beneath seats . BMW claims its seats recline more than competitors though . The front passenger seat if its unoccupied can also move forward and fold down to allow more space . BMW 7 Series buyers can get an optional 31-inch high-resolution video screen that folds down from the roof to provide entertainment for back seat passengers . Combined with an available high-end stereo system and powered window shades to block out light the 7 Series can be a better place to watch a movie than someones own living room according to BMW . Front seat occupants can also watch streaming videos on the center screen when the car is parked . Four-wheel steering will enable the car to turn more tightly on curvy roads and in parking lots and to change lanes more smoothly on the highway . Inside there are few knobs and buttons . Instead buttons appear as lighted icons on a strip of what looks like decorative trim that runs across the dashboard . The cars headlights are obscured by dark coverings while above them turn signals and daytime running lights are housed in prominent narrow bars . As an option the turn signals and daytime lights can include Swarovski crystals that sparkle in sunlight . As another option the 7 Series large kidney grille can be outlined in lights at night . For when the driver would rather not bother assistance technologies allow the driver to completely let go of the steering wheel for long periods on divided highways . This technology similar to General Motors Super Cruise requires drives to keep their eyes on the road ahead at all times . The 7 Series can automatically drive itself into and out of parking spaces even with the driver outside the vehicle using a smartphone app . It can also drive itself through a pre-programmed course such as around pylons in a parking garage on its own a feature somewhat similar to Teslas Summon mode . A sophisticated head up display which displays data in the cars windscreen can align images and text so they appear as if laid over roads and other features in the real world . The system can also display parking regulations in the area . Performance is a core part of BMWs and image . For decades BMWs marketing tagline was The Ultimate Driving Machine. Executives now say that electric vehicles will take the lead in the carmakers performance pantheon with the fastest and most powerful versions of its vehicles being battery-powered . With the new 7 Series the i7 shares its ranking as the most powerful version with the V8-powered 760i . There are no plans for a V12-powered 7-series model in this generation of the car . A sophisticated air suspension works automatically to keep the car level even in fast turns . Computers can use data from GPS maps and cameras on the front of the car to predict when an upcoming curve will require the suspension system to react . BMW has said that half of the cars the company sells worldwide will be electric by 2030 . That includes Rolls-Royce and Mini vehicles . Both of those iconic British ands are owned by BMW and plan to sell only electric vehicles by 2030 .|BMW|Automotive|CNN|Apr 20, 2022, 08:11 AM|BMW has introduced the i7, an electric version of its flagship 7 Series sedan, as part of its flexible electric vehicle strategy.

While it is not clear if the all-electric version will be based on the current generation of the car or a completely different future model, Reuss hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. This move aligns with GM's plan to produce only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. There have been rumors that the current generation of the Corvette, which features a gasoline engine mounted behind the seats, could be built with a hybrid system. GM President Mark Reuss has previously hinted at the possibility of electrified variants of the car. While it remains uncertain if the hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation, the announcement of an electrified version suggests that GM is exploring different options for the Corvette's powertrain. While most all-electric vehicles in production have been four-door sedans and SUVs, various companies are now working on electric sports cars. Tesla's first car, the Roadster, was an electric sports car, and a second-generation model has been unveiled as a prototype. However, the Corvette would be one of the first iconic American sports cars to offer an electrified version, joining the growing trend of high-performance electric vehicles. Hybrid systems can be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and provide quicker acceleration. Electric motors can deliver power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines, enhancing performance. This technology has been utilized by manufacturers like Ferrari, who have developed hybrid sports cars. The potential hybrid Corvette could leverage hybrid technology to enhance its performance capabilities. General Motors has announced its plan to produce only zero-emission vehicles, including fully electric or hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles, by 2035. The decision to offer an electrified version of the Corvette aligns with this commitment and demonstrates GM's dedication to transitioning to sustainable transportation. By expanding its electric vehicle offerings, GM aims to contribute to a greener future.|The Chevrolet Corvette is officially going electric|Y|General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette GM President Mark Reuss announced in aLinkedIn postMonday morning . Reuss didnt say when the electric Corvette would come but he hinted that a hyid model could come relatively soon . We will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year  he wrote . An accompanying video the company posted toTwittershowed what appeared to be a hyid Corvette and in another first showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered . All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only . While Reusss post implies a hyid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car its not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model . Electrified is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hyid to fully electric vehicles and anything with an electric motor can count as electrified. It has long been rumored that thecurrent generation of the Corvette the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front could be built with a hyid system . Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car . Various companies are working on electric sports cars . Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles . Teslas first car the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster was an electric sports car but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017 has yet to go into production . Some manufacturers such as Lamborghini have said that current battery technology doesnt allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle.Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hyid sports cars though . To date the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower.A670 horsepower Corvette Z06with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall . The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version . Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels . Besides saving gas hyid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines.Ferraris most powerful sports carsare hyids for instance .

Many out-of-work actors are turning to Cameo to earn income from fans who buy personalized celebrity videos, bridging the gap in their livelihoods. Several notable unionized stars, including Alyssa Milano, Cheyenne Jackson, Chris Wood, China McClain, and Melissa Benoist, have recently reactivated their Cameo accounts. These actors are using Cameo to connect with fans and earn extra income during the industry slowdown caused by the strike.

This provision, which allows employers to offer tax-free subsidies to offset the payment of principal and interest on workers' federal and private student loans, is set to expire on December 31, 2025. According to the Society of Human Resource Management's employer benefits survey, only 8% of organizations offer student loan benefits to employees, while 48% offer tuition assistance.

Most are not|Y|As borrowers prepare to resume paying their federal student loans in the coming weeks the IRS is reminding employers that they can help by offering workers up to $ 5,250 tax free as part of their educational assistance benefits . That $ 5,250 is the federal cap on the amount of tax-free money that employers may offer to help defray employees qualified costs for their own education including tuition and fees . Reimbursements above that threshold are treated as taxable income to the employee .

But its a limited time offer The provision is set to expire on December 31 2025 . Employers may craft their educational assistance plans to cover what they choose from the expenses deemed qualified by thesefederal guidelines . It appears however that not many have chosen to include student loan debt since those expenses were first allowed in 2020 . In response to the Society of Human Resource Managements 2023 employer benefits survey only 8 of organizations said they offer student loan benefits to employees a percentage that hasnt changed for five years . By contrast 48 said they offer tuition assistance . The reasons for that discrepancy are unclear . But lawmakers who advocated for tax-advantaged employer benefits to help with student loan payments are concerned there hasnt been enough public awareness of it . And they have asked the IRS to step up its outreach . In announcing a September 14 free webinar to educate employers about the provision IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said The IRS wants to make sure employers dont overlook this option that can help businesses attract and retain workers.

For adults working full time and carrying that debt reimbursements of up to $ 5,250 a year  or just under $ 438 a month  can be a boon to their bottom line . Even getting just $ 100 or $ 200 a month to offset payments can make a difference . That may be of particular interest now that the yearslong pause in payments on federal student loans isexpiring . The Federal Reserve has noted that those payments alone were typically between $ 200 and $ 299 a month before the payment pause went into effect in 2020 .

The measures include reducing minimum down payments for mortgages, slashing interest rates on new mortgages, and allowing renegotiation of rates on existing mortgages. This move is expected to benefit 40 million home buyers and impact 25 trillion yuan ($3.5 trillion) in mortgages. After the announcement of the new stimulus measures, several major commercial banks in China, including ICBC, China Construction Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China, have cut their deposit rates. This coordinated move is intended to pave the way for banks to lower their mortgage rates based on the regulators' new requirements. Nomura analysts believe that this action will help boost confidence in the housing market. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has decided to reduce the amount of foreign currency that banks must hold as reserves. This move is aimed at alleviating the pressure on the yuan, which has been falling rapidly in recent months. While the amount may be insignificant, it symbolizes the PBOC's commitment to curb the yuan's weakness. The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for China unexpectedly swung back to expansion in August. The index rose to 51, the highest level since February, indicating a notable improvement in factory activity. This data suggests that the Chinese economy is showing signs of stabilization, although the official government survey still indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector.|China takes aim at real estate crisis with new measures to boost economy|Y|China has rolled out a new batch of stimulus measuresto boost the nationC/sailing property marketand support a weakening yuan in its latest attempt to restore confidence inthe worldC/s second largest economy .

The company attributes its success to new customers, as well as its ability to retain existing customers and increase their spending. Lululemon also raised its expectations for net revenue for the rest of 2023. Dollar General, a discount store, issued a lower sales and profit outlook for the year, citing weaker consumer spending and increasing theft. The company's CEO mentioned that core customers feel financially constrained, possibly due to higher costs of living and cuts in SNAP payments.

The United States experienced high inflation, with the inflation rate peaking at over 9% in June 2022, the highest level in over 40 years.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned employees that non-compliance with the office attendance policy could impact their future at the company. Meta announced that employees assigned to an office must come in three days a week, with noncompliance potentially resulting in disciplinary action. Merck notified employees that office-based positions would require three days on-site, with consequences for non-attendance. According to security provider Kastle Systems, the average occupancy rate in office buildings in the 10 most populous US cities was 47.2% of pre-pandemic levels for the week between August 17 and August 23. This is an increase from the post-pandemic high of just over 50% in early June. Tuesday was the most popular day for employees to show up, with nearly 56% occupancy, while Friday had the lowest occupancy at 31%. A study by workplace analytics firm Basking found that the hours employees spend at work on the days they go into the office may be changing. In the first half of this year, only 55% of office visits on average lasted for more than 6 hours, compared to the pre-pandemic figure of 84%. This suggests a potential shift in work patterns and productivity during in-person office days. Surveys conducted by workplace consulting firms provide insights into the return-to-office policies and enforcement strategies of companies. A live poll survey by Gartner found that 45% of respondents ask employees to come to the office only a few days a week, while only 21% mandate return-to-office policies. Many companies do not have consequences for not meeting attendance requirements, but some enforce compliance through meetings, performance improvement plans, lower performance reviews, and reduced bonuses.|The state of return-to-office policies a post-Labor Day reset|Y|Some big-name employers are signaling they will get tough on enforcing their return-to-office mandates after Labor Day . Last month Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees they were free to disagree with the companys policy requiring them to be in the office at least three days a week . But he added if they dont comply their futures at Amazon might not be um ight . A few weeks prior the company had sent emails to some employees letting them know their badge swipes indicated they were not coming in as often as required . Meta meanwhile told employees that come September 5 thosealready assigned to an office must come inthree days a week and managers would track attendance according to areportfrom Business Insider . Noncompliance could result in disciplinary action including a lower performance rating or if unaddressed dismissal . Even if other employers haventpublicly laid out enforcement measures per se some have made a point of reiterating orannouncing new company expectations about how often they want employees in the office . Merck for example put employees on notice that effective September 5 those with office-based positions would be required to be on site three total days a week  two of which will be fixed . Its hard to say whether such moves by well-knowncompanies signal a oader trend of employers getting serious about enforcing RTO policies . But its a reminder that one of the biggest work experiments in history very much remains a work in progress . Heres a look at where things stand today more than three years after the pandemic forced manyemployers to accommodate work-from-home practices in a way they never had before . For the week between August 17 and August 23 the average occupancy rate in office buildings managed by security provider Kastle Systems was equivalent to 47.2 of pre-pandemic levels in the 10 most populous US cities . Thats up from a post-pandemic high of just over 50 in early June but above the 43 recorded in the same period a year ago . Kastle Systems operates card-swipe security machines in 2,600 office buildings across 138 US cities . Kastle found that Tuesday was the most popular day to show up with nearly 56 occupancy while Friday was the least popular at 31 . In the month of July roughly 4,000 full-time US employees whose work can be done remotely reported that their employer planned for them to work an average of 2.2 days at home every week and the rest on site according to the Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes which has been conducted monthly since May 2020 by researchers at Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico Stanford University and The University of Chicago . Respondents use a computer smartphone iPad or similar device to take the survey . Results are weighted to match the distribution of the target population of full-time US workers across age sex education and earnings categories in the Current Population Survey data . Meanwhile one study suggests the hours employees spend at work on the days they do go in may be changing . Using anonymized WiFi and other data workplace analytics firm Basking studied a small sampling of 26 US offices across seven mostly multinational employers and found that in the first half of this year only 55 of office visits on average lasted for more than 6 hours well below the pre-pandemic figure of 84 . For all the various data and research that seeks to capture the reality and impact of hyid work policies its hard to findnationally representative statistically significant samplings of HR executives detailing their organizations return-to-office policies or enforcement strategies . But some recent surveys by workplace consulting firms mayoffer a window into what somecompanies may do for the rest of the year . For example the HR team at Gartner which helps clients design and implement workplace policies did a live poll survey of 225 of its HR clients during a webinar on May 31 . Forty-five percent of respondents said they ask employees to come to the office only a few days a week. Only 21 of those participating in the webinar said they are mandating RTO policies . Nearly 40 said they do not have consequences for not meeting attendance requirements or recommendations. And among the HR executives who said their companies are trying to enforce compliance 44 said managers meet with individuals to strongly encourage behavior change. Only 15 said they put noncompliant employees on performance improvement plans while 8 lower performance reviews and 7 reduce bonuses .|Amazon|Technology|CNN|Sep 04, 2023, 01:02 PM|Big-name employers like Amazon, Meta, and Merck are cracking down on their return-to-office mandates, warning employees of potential consequences for non-compliance.

This investment indicates that Bill Gates has confidence in the beer company, despite its steep sales slump and recent controversies surrounding Bud Light's partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Since Bill Gates' purchase, Anheuser-Busch's stock has declined nearly 2% and is down about 7% for the year. The company reported a 10% decline in US revenue in the second quarter, primarily due to falling Bud Light sales. The decline in sales was isolated to the United States, as revenue in Canada actually rose. Modelo, a beer brand, overtook Bud Light in sales at grocery and beer stores. This marks the first time Modelo has beaten Bud Light on a year-to-date basis. However, the difference in market share is slim, with Modelo holding 8.34% of dollars spent on beer compared to Bud Light's 8.28%. Anheuser-Busch announced layoffs affecting approximately 380 positions within its US employee population. This decision was made as the company continues to face challenges in its sales and revenue, particularly with the decline in Bud Light sales.

The Australian Offshore Alliance, representing 500 workers at the Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities, described Chevron's bargaining performance as the most inept effort of any employer in the past 5 years. The industrial action, including work stoppages, has begun and could potentially impact up to 7% of global LNG supplies. News of the breakdown in talks between Chevron and the workers' union has led to a rise in European natural gas prices. Dutch gas futures, which serve as a benchmark for the region, climbed 9.8% on Friday. Europe has become more dependent on global LNG supplies since deliveries of pipeline gas from Russia slumped, and a prolonged disruption to global supplies could further push up prices. The drawn-out dispute at Chevron's LNG facilities in Australia could have significant implications for global LNG supply and competition. The two Chevron sites account for approximately 6% of global supply, and if strikes were to stop production for a month, around 7% of global supply would be wiped out.

This move marks a milestone for the company in adopting universal charging and streamlining the charging process across various devices. The switch is in compliance with the European Union's legislation requiring smartphones and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024. Although Apple has previously switched its iPads and MacBooks to USB-C charging, the company has been resistant to making the change on the iPhone. Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Greg Joswiak, expressed the value and ubiquity of the Lightning charger but acknowledged the need to comply with the EU mandate. The shift to USB-C could generate more e-waste in the short term as people phase out their Lightning cables. Apple has financial reasons for pushing back on the switch to USB-C. The company makes money from selling Lightning cables and accessories, as well as taking a cut from third-party accessories through its Made For iPhone program. Moving to USB-C would reduce Apple's control over its ecosystem, as USB-C is a more open ecosystem. However, Apple could create its own branded USB-C cable to optimize performance and minimize risk and damage to batteries. The shift to USB-C may not be a sole incentive for people to upgrade to the iPhone 15, but it could sway some consumers who have been resistant due to charging limitations. The devices are expected to ship with a new cable in the box, and considering the widespread use of USB-C in other devices, access to charging wires should not be difficult or costly. In the long term, the switch to USB-C is likely to benefit consumers with a universal charging system. While Apple could bypass wired charging altogether to make way for wireless charging, it is unlikely to happen soon due to the slower speed of wireless charging compared to wired charging.

The rule applies to image, video, and audio content and is aimed at preventing the spread of election misinformation. The policy update comes as campaign season for the 2024 US presidential election ramps up. Digital information integrity experts have raised alarms about the use of AI-generated text, audio, and video in political advertisements. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology has made it cheap and easy to create convincing AI-generated content, which could lead to a wave of election misinformation. Social media platforms and regulators may be ill-prepared to handle this issue. AI-generated images have already been used in political advertisements. In one example, a video posted by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign used AI-generated images showing former President Donald Trump hugging Dr. Anthony Fauci. The images were designed to criticize Trump and were difficult to spot as AI-generated. The Republican National Committee also released an advertisement using AI images to imagine a dystopian United States after the reelection of President Joe Biden. Google's policy update requires disclosures on ads using synthetic content that could mislead users. Ads with synthetic content that makes it appear as if a person is saying or doing something they didn't say or do would need a label. However, the policy does not apply to synthetic or altered content that is inconsequential to the claims made in the ad, such as image resizing or color corrections. A group of top artificial intelligence companies, including Google, agreed to voluntary commitments to improve safety around their AI technologies. As part of the agreement, the companies will develop technical mechanisms, such as watermarks, to ensure users know when content was generated by AI.

Comparing the week of Aug. 14 to Aug. 21 Etsy reported a 25 increase in searches for disco hats and a 25 increase in searches for silver blouses corsets or tops .

For the most part Erin Fritts owner of Etsy store EverwindCreationss in Charlotte North Carolina said shes been able to send merchandise out the next day and overnight if needed . At a pivotal moment during each concert Beyonc(c) flicks her wrist and pans out her black handheld fan . The crowd waves their own in the air  many of them potentially bought from local Etsy sellers . Fritts is selling around five to eight silver holographic fans each day . Before the tour it was around three . She found a holographic and iridescent material and is stocking up for her manufacturer . To seeTaylor Swift and Beyonc(c)fueling all of these small business buyers its great honestly  Fritts said .

Handheld fans along with the Renaissance album and tour draw inspiration fromBallroom culture a Black and Latinx LGBTQ+ subculture that has roots in drag queens organizing pageant competitions at balls. The ball scene is constructed of houses  which function as alternative families for those who could be ostracized from their own where competitors walk the runway or vogue for cash prizes and trophies said Sydney Baloue a ballroom historian writer and artist . Concertgoers are dressing the part amplifying the culture along with supporting small businesses . Beyonc(c) collaborated with so many people who were part of that culture  Baloue said . She added her own flair to it . And it allowed so many new people who otherwise might not at all be privy or even curious about this world get access to the culture. The fans popularity is also for a practicalreason . Beyonc(c) and Swift are packing concertgoers into outdoor stadiums . Extreme heat from Florida to the Southwest and California can make an uncomfortable experience for attendees  and a marketing opportunity for small businesses . The hand fans are especially in the summer months Fritts said . Tracy Swank who owns SwazzleStudio out of Baltimore first designed sunglasses for herself and her niece . As more friends were attending Beyonc(c) and Swift concerts under the unrelenting sun they requested sunglasses too eventually leading to an Etsy shop . For Beyonc(c)s fanbase known as the Beyhive Swank created black and yellow glasses adorned with a bee on them . That demand was quickly replaced with silver bedazzled shades earlier this month after Beyonc(c)s silver announcement . So far Swank has earned $ 800 from selling those glasses . Accessories matter from cowboy boots to earrings . One supplier is DaKeitha Bennett who runs DMoniqueDesigns on Etsy from Flint Michigan . Shes running out of her silver Cuff It earrings after the song at least once a week after putting up about 20 to 30 pairs .

https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/09/business/lordstown-plants-ev-future/index.html|Closure of Lordstown Assembly factory; Sale and bankruptcy of Lordstown Motors; Formation of joint venture Ultium Cells; Pay increase for Ultium plant workers; Contract negotiations and potential strike|The Lordstown Assembly factory, a massive facility in Ohio, was closed by General Motors just months before its contract with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union expired in 2019. This closure, along with the closure of three other US plants, sparked a six-week strike at GM. The UAW won many of its bargaining goals with the strike, but Lordstown was left without new vehicles to build. Less than a month after settling with the UAW, GM sold the Lordstown plant to Lordstown Motors, an upstart EV truck maker. However, Lordstown Motors faced financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. The factory is now owned by Foxconn, which plans to make EVs for another upstart, Fisker, starting in 2025. In 2019, GM formed a joint venture with Korean manufacturer LG to build batteries for EVs. The joint venture, Ultium Cells, is crucial to GM's plans to shift to an all-EV lineup by 2035. The Ultium plant, which started building batteries last August, now has 1,100 hourly workers who are represented by the UAW. The UAW successfully negotiated a pay increase for workers at the Ultium plant, with starting wages increasing from $16.50 to $20.50 per hour. However, this is still significantly lower than the wages of veteran autoworkers at GM, Ford, and Stellantis plants. The UAW aims to include Ultium workers in GM's national labor agreement in the future. The UAW is currently in contract negotiations with GM, Ford, and Stellantis, seeking pay increases of at least 40%. The contract expires soon, and the union has threatened to go on strike if an agreement is not reached. The discussions include the shift to EVs and the union's demand for a 'just transition' for workers in the industry.|Two neighboring Ohio factories one new one closed could tell the future of US auto industry|Y|The massive Lordstown Assembly factory in Ohio nearly the size of the Pentagon more than 50 years old and nearly empty is a reminder of the past strength of both General Motors and the United Auto Workers union . The much smaller new electric vehicle battery factory next door could be the future for both the company and the union . The Lordstown plant opened in 1966 GM closed itjust months before its contract with the UAW expired in 2019 . That closing along with that ofthree other US plants helpedspark a six-week strikeat the nationC/s largest automaker . The UAW won many of its bargaining goals with that strike includingnew life for one of those four doomed plants which today is building EVs . But Lordstown was left without new vehicles to build . C/ItC/s a blight on this town . ItC/d be a blight on any community C/ said David Green . He worked at Lordstown for 24 years and is now a regional director for the union in Ohio and Indiana . Less than a month aftersettling with the union GM announced thesale of the plantto an upstart EV truck maker Lordstown Motors . That company made afew dozen trucksand a few hundred million dollars in losses . Itfiled for bankruptcyearlier this year . Today the factory is owned today byFoxconn the contract manufacturer best known for building iPhones which plans to make EVs for another upstart Fisker starting in 2025 . Whether that comes to pass remains to be seen . The factory dwarfed its namesake town of 3,000 people . In the 1970s the union says it once employed up to 15,000 hourly workers . In 2016 nearly 4,000 people worked there . The eastern Ohio Turnpike parallels the massive plant for nearly a mile . But GM isnC/t gone from the area C/ not entirely . The automaker still has a presence in Lordstown with partial ownership of an EV battery plant a key to its plans to convert completely from internal combustion vehicles to EVs by the middle of next decade . And if the UAW is going to remain a power in the auto industry it will need to win contracts for EV workers . The union has had some successes at the battery plant fromwinning an organizing votetolanding raisesfor workers . Some former Lordstown workers helped secure that recent pay hike . C/I thought I was going to retire from Lordstown C/ said Eric Manaro a member of the negotiating team who is one of those Lordstown veterans . When he got the job at the plant where his dad worked in 2008 C/I thought I had won the lottery.C/ In 2019 GM formed a joint venture with Korean manufacturer LG to build the massive batteries that power EVs . The joint venture Ultium Cells is the key to GMC/s plans to shift to an all-EV lineup of vehicles by 2035 even though EVs make up only a small fraction of its sales today . The Ultium plant just over a third of the size of the closed Lordstown plant started building batteries last August . In December nearly 900 hourly employees voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining the UAW . It now has 1,100 hourly workers . But that union membership doesnC/t mean the Ultium workers are making the same as UAW members at assembly or engine plants operated by GM Ford or Stellantis the C/Big ThreeC/ unionized automakers . Most of those 145,000 union members get $ 32.32 an hour . When Ultium opened starting pay was $ 16.50 an hour . Although the union got Ultium to agree last month to increase wages by between $ 3 and $ 4 an hour the new $ 20.50-an-hour starting wage is still about 36 less than wages of veteran autoworkers at the Big ThreeC/s plants . UAW leadership at the plant says the raise is only a first step . Its goal is to someday get the members at the plant included in GMC/s national labor agreement . But they wonC/t predict when that will happen . C/Everyone understands this is far below that pay now C/ said Manaro . C/ItC/s not the be-all and end-all of wages at this point.C/ But he said the workers are happy with this raise even if they see it as only a first step . They voted 97 in favor of ratifying the deal . C/Members are looking at a minimum of $ 600 more a month . Who wouldnC/t want that C/ said Manaro . Many workers in Lordstown were second- even third-generation autoworkers there . Justin BrownC/s father worked at the Lordstown plant for nearly nearly 50 years Brown for 10 years . He moved to a GM plant in Missouri in the hopes that Lordstown would soon reopen . He thought the 2019 strike would save the plant . He never got to move back . C/IC/m grateful to have a job but I just miss my family C/ he said on a trip back to visit parents last month . C/There isnC/t a day that goes by that I donC/t think C/They need me.C/C/ Manaro and some others at Ultium say about 20 of the workers there are former Lordstown employees . Some Ultium workers said they took the lower-paying job with the expectation that they would someday make GM-level pay . George Goranitis transferred to a GM plant in Spring Hill Tennessee when Lordstown closed but got homesick and tired of making a nine-hour drive to and from his new plant back to see his family and friends on the weekends . C/I wasnC/t happy in Spring Hill by myself C/ he said . So he quit GM and came back to Lordstown taking a series of jobs including a stint as a correctional officer . He jumped at the chance to get a job at Ultium even though it paid less than some other jobs that were available . ThatC/s because he expects Ultium will eventually be paying GM-level wages . C/Like at General Motors everyone at Ultium wants to get their foot in the door C/ he said. But itC/s not clear if GM can be competitive with other automakers if it pays battery plant employees what assembly line workers are getting . The nonunion automakers are building or planning a dozen EV battery plants of their own most spread across the overwhelmingly nonunion South . The UAW is now seeking pay increases of at least 40 in contract negotiations with GM Ford and Stellantis . The contract expires at 11:59 pm Thursday and the union said it will go on strike against any companies that donC/t come to an agreement before then . The Ultium plant workers arenC/t at the table for those talks C/ but in a sense they are part of the discussion The Big ThreeC/s plans to shift to EVs are a key sticking point . Electric vehicles have far fewer parts compared to combustion engines . Fewer parts means less labor C/ about 30 less . Many of the lost jobs will be at engine and transmission plants that the companies own and whose workers are included in the current labor contracts . But to build EVs GM Ford and Stellantis have formed joint ventures like Ultium with foreign battery companies those employees will not directly work for the unionized automakers . There are ninemore of those plants associated with the Big ThreeC/s joint ventures set to open in the next few years . The union says it is demanding a C/just transitionC/ from gas-powered vehicles to EVs as part of any contract . For the union that means significantly higher pay at the battery plants and the right for workers who lose their jobs at existing plants to move to jobs at the battery plant . Whether the union can win those guarantees remains to be seen . The autoworkers at Ultium are hoping the battery plant will be such a success that it leads GM to reopen Lordstown and build EVs there itself . But even so they have not given up hope that they can hold off the EV wave awhile longer said David Green the UAW regional director . C/I think GM knows the internal combustion engine isnC/t going anywhere anytime soon C/ he said .|General Motors|Automotive|CNN|Sep 09, 2023, 10:05 AM|The Lordstown Assembly factory in Ohio, previously owned by General Motors (GM), was closed and later sold to Lordstown Motors, which filed for bankruptcy.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/09/economy/manufacturing-fed-recession/index.html|President Joe Biden visits Auburn Manufacturing; Federal interest rate hike raises concerns; Manufacturing boom fueled by federal funds and renewable energy shift; US manufacturing sector faces challenges|President Joe Biden visited Auburn Manufacturing, a specialized textiles maker in Maine, to tout the success of his economic agenda. He highlighted the rising investments in construction projects by manufacturers as evidence of the growth in blue-collar work. This visit showcased the administration's focus on supporting manufacturing and boosting the economy. The Federal Reserve approved raising interest rates to their highest level in over 22 years, continuing their aggressive inflation-busting campaign. Economists are uncertain about the impact of these rate hikes on the economy. While the fiscal support provided by recent spending packages has boosted manufacturing, the rate hikes could potentially weigh on the industry. The injection of federal funds, including the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the CHIPS and Science Act, has allowed manufacturers to plan new factories and ramp up production. Additionally, the country's ongoing shift towards renewable energy has sparked a manufacturing boom in the United States. Economists estimate that the industry could add 250,000 jobs over the next two years. Despite the optimism among US consumers, business surveys indicate that the manufacturing sector has been contracting for several months. Weakening consumer demand, shrinking backlogs, and difficulties in hiring have contributed to this contraction. While manufacturers have increased spending on building factories, the short-term outlook remains uncertain, especially for manufacturers not directly benefiting from federal funds.|America is in a factory boom again .

At first she replied C/President of what C/ Leonard told CNN . Then the Maine official clarified she was referring to President Joe Biden . C/I was like C/Really Is this a true call C/C/ Leonard said . C/But I was eventually convinced and said yes of course weC/re going to do it . I mean you donC/t say no to such an opportunity.C/ The following Friday at Auburn Manufacturing located about an hour north of Portland Bidentouted the success of his economic agenda pointing to manufacturersC/ rising investments in construction projects as evidence . In the growth of blue-collar work Biden has much to celeate . In July construction spending from manufacturers rose about 71 from a year earlier according to Commerce Department data and manufacturers had 106,000 more employees in August compared to a year earlier despite business surveys showing softening consumer demand . But the good times for the US economy may not last . A few days before BidenC/s speech in Maine the Fed approved raising interest rates to their highest level in more than 22 years continuing an aggressive inflation-busting campaign . Now as the US central bank looks to enter the final phases of its historic inflation battle itC/s unclear how much the rate hikes will weigh on the economy . But economists argue the fiscal largesse of recent years is providing an unshakable economic boost to manufacturing . Some manufacturing bosses like Leonard are confident their companies could handle a recession . Since taking office in 2021 Biden has signed into law a number of major spending packages to funnel billions of dollars toward manufacturing includinga bipartisan infrastructure billand theCHIPS and Science Act . That has allowed manufacturers to start planning new factories to ramp up production according to government data . The injection of federal funds and the countryC/s ongoing shift toward renewable energy have helped spark the beginning of a so-called C/manufacturing boomC/ in the United States according to some economists C/ notably Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman . Goldman Sachs analysts recently estimated the US manufacturing industry could add 250,000 jobs over two years . But the steady rise in construction spending from manufacturers hasnC/t yet translated into significantly higher levels of manufacturing employment or a sharp uptick in output . Although economic optimism has grown among US consumers andfears of a severe downturn from economists have greatly diminishedin recent weeks the economy isnC/t out of the woods just yet . There are reasons for concern . Business surveys from S P Global and the Institute for Supply Management show that the US manufacturing sectorhas been contractingfor several months . The surveys reflect weakening consumer demand coupled with shrinking backlogs and a persistent difficulty in hiring . ISMC/s latest survey showed economic activity among manufacturers contracted for the 10th straight month in August . C/Customer orders have softened . This is likely due to customersC/ increased confidence in the supply chain which has them reducing their inventories . Customers are also being pinched with higher interest rates C/ a food beverage and tobacco products manufacturer told the ISM in its August survey . C/Additionally consumers are feeling their purchasing power eroded by stubbornly high inflation so they are purchasing less.C/ The outlook isnC/t too rosy C/ at least in the short term . C/ItC/s not a big surprise that the combination of higher interest rates and a moderation of the pandemic surge in consumer purchases has led to weaker readings in the PMIs which are short-term data C/ said Scott Paul the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing . A PMI or purchasing managersC/ index is a business survey used to gauge levels of economic activity C/ the same ones released by S P Global and ISM . Historically manufacturing has been hit hard in economic downturns . During the Great Recession which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009 manufacturing job losses totaled more than 2 million employees or 15 of its workforce according toa 2011 paperfrom the Labor Department . If the economy does enter a recession Paul argues mass layoffs could be avoided because of C/public policies that spurred infrastructure investments manufacturing demand and clean energy incentives C/ referring to the federal spending packages and their provisions . Economists say manufacturersC/ increased spending on building factories reflects their confidence in the long term even if data show demand is expected to slow in the short term . It takes time to build a factory . The construction spending figures imply investments toward building factories . However Paul said itC/s not clear how certain manufacturers who arenC/t directly benefiting from federal dollars C/ such as manufacturers of packaged food or clothing C/ would fare in a recession . But Auburn ManufacturingC/s Leonard is confident about her companyC/s ability to weather a recession saying C/weC/ve been through ups and downs.C/ Indeed Leonard has seen much higher interest rates in the past . C/When we built our first building interest rates were around 14 or so and that was in the early C/80s C/ she said . The FedC/s benchmark lending rate is currently at a range of 5.25-5.5 . It hovered between 8 and 19.5 in the early 1980s . Likewise Julianna Keeling founder and chief executive of Terravive a manufacturer of sustainable single-use consumer products said she believes her business would not do as well during a recession but would avoid a deep slump due to C/very strong demand from people wanting to use disposable sustainable products that they donC/t have to feel guilty about discarding.C/ Companies typically take out corporate loans when expanding their operations so higher borrowing costs could stymie some manufacturersC/ growth plans . The developers of River Pointe Commerce Park a proposed industrial park in eastern PennsylvaniaC/s Lehigh Valley say demand for leases from manufacturers has been strong . However Lou Pektor one of the developers said C/the Fed factors into everybodyC/s thinkingC/ C/ especially when it comes to growth plans . C/WeC/ve seen some plans go on hold or on a slower burn until those companies see what happens with interest rates and the economy C/ he said . It is the typical dynamic during times of economic uncertainty C/ waiting for some clarity before making a major business investment . Jennifer Harris former special assistant to Biden and senior director of international economics at the National Economic Council and the National Security Council said she thinks a soft landing C/ a scenario in which inflation slows to the FedC/s 2 goal without a sharp uptick in unemployment or a recession C/ is within reach and would bode well for manufacturers . Recession or not the bull case for US manufacturing has the industry C/ and Biden C/ in a good mood .|Auburn Manufacturing|Industrial|CNN|Sep 09, 2023, 02:33 PM|President Joe Biden visited Auburn Manufacturing in Maine to highlight the success of his economic agenda and the rising investments in construction projects by manufacturers.

Perhaps the biggest change coming to the iPhone 15 models is the switch to USB-C charging, ending an 11-year run with Apple's proprietary Lightning charging cable. This change allows Apple customers to use the same USB-C chargers for their iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers, simplifying the charging process. The switch aligns with the European Union's legislation to require USB-C charging support by 2024.|6 takeaways from Apples iPhone 15 event|Y|Apple unveiled its iPhone 15 lineup along with other major updates during itsSeptember keynote eventon Tuesday . The company announced it will switch toUSB-C charging from its proprietary Lightning charging cable with the iPhone 15 marking a milestone for the company by adopting universal charging . The change aims to ultimately streamline the charging process across various devices  and ands . The company also showed off its Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches with new colors and features including gesture control and a new iteration of its AirPods Pro wireless earbuds also with USB-C charging . The iPhone charger update along with changes to its design and camera system comes as Apple looks to give consumers more reasons to upgrade their iPhones . Last month Apples salesfell for the third consecutive quarter . iPhone revenue came in at $ 39.7 billion for the quarter marking an approximately 2 year-over-year decline as people update their devices less often . Apple on Tuesday said it will not raise prices for the iPhone 15 lineup which could furtherincentivize users to upgrade . Here are the main takeaways from Apples Tuesday event The latest iPhones are packed with subtle but significant design changes . To start the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now feature a titanium casing allowing the design to be slimmer and thinner than before . Other design changes on the premium models include a more-advanced 48 megapixel main camera with a larger sensor and a new telephoto lens for 5x optical zoom camera exclusively on iPhone 15 Pro Max . The new Pro models design also features contoured edges and a customizable Action button which gives the ring/silence button additional controls from starting a voice memo to writing a note . Meanwhile the basic iPhone 15 phones now include updated image stabilization for taking photos and videos 2x optimization and updated portraits with richer color and better low-light performance . They will also come with the Dynamic Island tool  home to alerts notifications and other controls in place of the notch  which were previously only available on the iPhone 14 Pro .

Now Apple customers can use the sameUSB-C chargersto power their iPhones iPads and Mac computers  no more scrambling to find the right charger for each device . Apple said a dedicated USB-C controller will allow for transfer speeds of up to 20 times faster than with USB-2 technology for the iPhone 15 Pro . The switch would come less than a year after the European Union voted to approve legislation to require smartphones tablets digital cameras portable speakers and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024 . The first-of-its-kind law aims to pare down the number of chargers and cables consumers must contend with when they purchase a new device and to allow users to mix and match devices and chargers even if they were produced by different manufacturers . Apple will also sell a $ 29 USB-C Lightning adapter to let people connect their existing Lightning accessories to a USB-C-enabled iPhone or iPad to charge or share data . The company told CNN that iPhone users can recycle their old Lightning chargers via its in-store recycling program . Apple kicked off Tuesdays event by announcing the new Apple Watch Series 9 which features Apples in-house silicon chip and ultrawideband connectivity . The updated Apple Watch will let users log health data with their voice use name drop to share contact information by touching another Apple Watch and raise their wrist to automatically ighten the display .

The hand gesture can also scroll through widgets much like turning the digital crown . The company said Double Tap is enabled by an enhanced neural engine that processes data from sensors and machine learning and by monitoring the change in blood flow when two fingers are tapped together . It is available starting next month . A similar hand tap will be used to control the Vision Pro mixed reality headset when it launches next year . Apples next-generation software for the iPhone will be available to download starting on Monday September 18 . In June the company showed off a slew of new tools coming to iOS 17 such as a more accurate autocorrect a new feature called Live Voicemail that will transcribe a callers message in real time and a NameDrop tool that lets users share their contact information by holding two iPhones close together . The iPhones phone app will also reposition the hang up button to the bottom right of the screen next to other functions . The update will also ing adaptive audio to the AirPods Pro which will adjust the noise cancellation and volume based on a users surroundings and introduce conversation mode which customizes the sound of what youre listening to and softens when you start speaking to someone nearby . Lisa Jackson Apples VP of environment policy and social initiatives said that the companys Watch Series 9 will be Apples first-ever carbon-neutral product  thanks to efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to offset emissions with carbon buybacks . She said this has been certified by an independent third-party . Doubling down on sustainability initiatives Jackson also said the tech giant will no longer use leather in any new Apple product including watch bands . Instead of leather Apple said it will begin using a new textile that it is calling fine woven. Fine woven will be made of 68 post-consumer recycled content giving it a significantly lower carbon footprint than leather Apple said . Beyond expected improved performance and incremental innovation embedded into Apples new products it is great to see Apple communicate on sustainability as a new competitive advantage  especially with Apples first carbon neutral products  Forrester Principal Analyst Thomas Husson said in emailed commentary following the event .|Apple|Technology|CNN|Sep 12, 2023, 10:09 PM|Apple unveiled its iPhone 15 lineup and major updates during its September keynote event.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/12/tech/old-iphone-chargers-dispose-reuse/index.html|Apple transitioning to a charging cable compatible with non-Apple products; Impact of retiring the Lightning cable on e-waste; The importance of closing the loop in e-waste management|Apple is finally abandoning its proprietary Lightning port in the iPhone 15 and adopting a charging cable that is compatible with non-Apple products. This move, prompted by a European regulatory mandate, is largely symbolic as most other gadgets have already switched to USB-C. While it may not significantly reduce e-waste, it is an important step towards creating a common charger across devices and raising awareness about the issue. Retiring the Lightning cable could potentially lead to a surge of e-waste in the short term as iPhone users discard their useless cables. However, the overall impact on global e-waste is expected to be minimal, as charging cables account for only a few hundred thousand tons out of the 66 million tons of electronic waste generated each year. Nevertheless, this transition is an important step in addressing the growing e-waste problem and making people aware of the issue. E-waste is a growing problem that often ends up in closets and junk drawers instead of being properly treated. This leads to the need for more mining of materials like copper, gold, and platinum to produce new products. While the EU rule may not directly reduce waste, it can encourage manufacturers like Apple to make it easier to refurbish and recycle old products, ultimately helping to close the loop and promote reuse over recycling.|Apple just killed the iPhone Lightning connector . What to do with your old chargers|Y|"At long last Apple iskillingits proprietary Lightning port in theiPhone 15and emacing a charging cable thats compatible with non-Apple products . Thats one less extra cord cluttering your nightstand . One less thing to forget when packing for a weekend getaway . But the move hastened by a Europeanregulatory mandatepassed last year is a largely symbolic measure that comes years after most other gadgets switched to USB-C. And it wont do much to shrink the mountains of e-waste piling up around the globe . I would classify the EU law and Apple as an evolution not a revolution  says Marian Chertow a professor of industrial environmental management at the Yale School of the Environment . When the European Commission passed the directive last year it cited two motivations First everyone agrees that its super annoying to have so many cables lying around . Second having a common charger across devices  whether theyre made by Apple or Samsung or Garmin or whoever  would significantly reduce electronic waste. Apple initially pushed back of course partly because selling extra Lightning cables made it lots of money . But it also said the waste argument was misguided and that the promise of wireless charging would make the cable issue moot . Still the company ultimately said it would comply with the common cable rules . Retiring the Lightning cable could even generate in the short term a surge of e-waste as iPhone users toss their useless Lightning cables in a drawer . Which to be clear isnt recommended . Apple says it has a robust recycling program where you can ing in used chargers and cables . You can also look for a local e-waste recycling center orBest Buy storefor environmentally friendly options . Big-picture though the impact on the mountains of global e-waste will likely be minimal . There are about 66 million tons of electronic waste generated each year says Ruediger Kuehr head of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research in Bonn Germany . Charging cables he said account for a few hundred thousand tons. When we look to the pure numbers its close to nothing  Kuehr said . But we nevertheless think its a very important step in order to make people | aware of the issue we are facing. E-waste is a growing problem that has yet to enter the mainstream consciousness . Most of it ends up where it shouldnt  in our closets and junk drawers  which means more materials such as copper gold and platinum have to be mined to produce new products . You can make money out of it but you have to really do a lot of steps  Kuehr says . This is not understandable for the consumer in comparison to all the other waste streams. Nearly 80 of all e-waste generated around the globe is not properly treated he said . Whether the EU rule actually reduces waste is beside the point if it can push Apple and other manufacturers to help close the loop by making it easier to refurbish and recycle old products . And to Apples credit the company has been a leader in scraping off rare earth metals from its reuse pile to recover these expensive materials  Chertow says noting that last year Apple said it was reusing more than two-thirds of the aluminum it needed . These days waste experts find that reuse is most often a better path than recycling as more can be recovered. CNNs Samantha Murphy Kelly contributed to this article .

Airlines are trying to boost demand during the off-peak season by offering lower prices. Prices to top international destinations, including Europe, are down 31% from summer peaks. Domestic airfare prices for September and October are averaging $211 per ticket, down 29% from average prices in June, July, and August. This drop in prices is typical during the fall shoulder season when demand cools off after the busy summer months. Airlines are slashing prices to incentivize travelers to book trips before the winter holidays. The Federal Reserve is projecting a travel slowdown this fall, as several of its regional districts reported peaking or slowing tourism activity. While international travel saw a surge this summer, the Fed expects a decrease in travel demand during the fall season. This projection aligns with the typical trend of reduced travel after the peak summer months. Frontier Airlines has flagged lower bookings in recent weeks, with sales trending below historical seasonality patterns. As a result, the airline is forecasting an adjusted loss for the quarter. This decrease in bookings could be attributed to the projected travel slowdown and rising fuel prices, which may impact ticket prices. American Airlines has reported a considerable increase in fuel prices since July, which may lead to higher ticket prices. The airline is currently paying about $3 per gallon for jet fuel.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/13/tech/iphone-15-usb-c-charging/index.html|Apple adopts USB-C charging system; Apple customers can use USB-C chargers for multiple devices; Apple's financial and environmental considerations|Apple announced at its iPhone 15 event that all of its next-generation smartphones will launch with USB-C charging, marking a milestone moment for the company. This move comes after years of resistance from Apple to switch from its proprietary Lightning charger. The switch to USB-C will make charging easier for customers and aligns with the European Union's legislation requiring devices to support USB-C charging by 2024. With the adoption of USB-C charging, Apple customers can now use the same USB-C chargers to power their iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. This eliminates the need to find the right charger for each device and allows for charging between devices. The switch to USB-C charging is a significant disruption to iPhone design and provides convenience and compatibility for Apple users. While Apple has financial reasons for resisting the switch to USB-C charging, such as revenue from selling Lightning cables and accessories, the company is complying with the European Union's mandate. The move to USB-C also aligns with environmental efforts to tackle e-waste. Apple is selling a USB-C to Lightning adapter to connect existing Lightning accessories to USB-C-enabled devices, and it has a recycling program for used chargers and cables.|Heres why Apples charger switch is such a big deal|Y|Apple retired its Lightning charger on Tuesday exactly 11 years to the day it was first announced . The effort marks a milestone moment for the company by finally adopting USB-C a universal charging system . Thats noteworthy not only because Apple has been resistant to do so for years but because its about to make charging that much easier for its customers . But as with most things theres a catch The switch to a universal standard means Apple is giving up control of its wired charging ecosystem and identifying good chargers from bad ones wont be obvious to many consumers . At its iPhone 15 event the companyannouncedall of its next-generation smartphones will launch with USB-C charging and so will the latest iteration of its AirPods Pro . Although Apple has previously switched its iPads and MacBooks to USB-C charging it has been resistant to making the change on the iPhone until now . The switch would come less than a year after the European Union voted to approve legislation to require smartphones tablets digital cameras portable speakers and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024 . The first-of-its-kind law aims to pare down the number of chargers and cables consumers must contend with when they purchase a new device and to allow users to mix and match devices and chargers even if they were produced by different manufacturers . Now Apple customers can use the same USB-C chargers to power their iPhones iPads and Mac computers  no more scrambling to find the right charger for each device . Charging can also occur between devices such as connecting a low-battery iPhone to a fully-charged iPad or similarly between different ands . This is arguably the biggest disruption to iPhone design for several years but in reality it is hardly a dramatic move  said Ben Wood an analyst at CCS Insight . Last year Apples senior vice president of worldwide marketing Greg Joswiak notedthe value and ubiquity of the Lightning charger which is designed for faster device charging but noted obviously we will have to comply with the EU mandate . We have no choice like we do around the world to comply with local laws but we think the approach would have been better environmentally and better for our customers to not have a government have that perspective  Joswiak said at the time . The EUs decision is part of a greater effort to tackle e-waste overall but could it generate more in the short term as people phase out their Lightning cables . Although Apple has voiced environmental concerns over what happens to old Lightning chargers it has financial reasons for pushing back on the change too . Apple introduced the Lightning charger alongside the iPhone 5 in 2012 replacing its existing 30-pin dock connector with one that enabled faster charging and had a reversible design . It also ignited a related accessories business requiring users to buy a $ 30 Lightning adapter to connect the device to older docks alarm clocks and speaker systems . For Apple it was all about being in control of its own ecosystem  said David McQueen a director at ABI Research . Apple makes good money from selling Lightning cables and its many related accessories. It also takes a financial cut from the third-party accessories and cables that go through its Made For iPhone program . Moving to USB Type C would take away this level of control as USB-C is a much more open ecosystem  McQueen said . Apple is now selling a new $ 29 USB-C to Lightning adapter to allow people to connect their existing Lightning accessories to a USB-C-enabled iPhone or iPad to charge or share data . Similarly Apple introduced a $ 29 dongle back in 2012 to connect the iPhone 5  the first phone with its Lightning charger  to old docks alarm clock radios and speaker systems . The move to USB-C wont likely be an incentive for people to upgrade but it could sway some consumers who have been resistant to the iPhone over its charging limitations according to Thomas Husson a vice president at Forrester Research . Considering many mobile devices already use USB-C including Apples own iPads and MacBooks access to charging wires shouldnt be too hard or costly . But knockoffs abound and some USB-C chargers are much safer than others . Some may provide too much power and others not enough . Some can regulate the flow of electricity and data to your phone  and others cant . Among CNN Underscoredstop recommendations for USB-C chargersare from big ands including Anker Belkin Apple Amazon and Google . Given how widely USB-C has been used in other devices its hard to imagine that customers will be totally caught out by this switch and in the long term its likely to benefit them with a universal charging system having some very obvious upsides  Wood said . Apple also said a dedicated USB-C controller will allow for transfer speeds of up to 20 times faster than with USB-2 technology for the iPhone 15 Pro . Retiring the Lightning cable could even generate in the short term asurge of e-wasteas iPhone users toss their useless Lightning cables in a drawer . But Apple told CNN it has an existing robust recycling program where you can ing in used chargers and cables . Its also possible to look for a local e-waste recycling center or Best Buy store for environmentally friendly options .|Apple|Technology|CNN|Sep 13, 2023, 12:29 PM|Apple announced at its iPhone 15 event that all of its next-generation smartphones will launch with USB-C charging, aligning with the European Union's legislation requiring devices to support USB-C charging by 2024.

Airlines started charging fees for checked bags, leading to an increase in carry-on bags and a decrease in efficiency during boarding. Bag fees have become a significant source of revenue for airlines. To accommodate various passenger segments and sell priority boarding, airlines introduced different boarding zones and groups, resulting in a longer boarding process. Larger aircraft and higher passenger load factors have contributed to congestion during boarding, as more passengers need to find their seats and store their luggage. Airlines have tried different boarding methods, such as boarding from back to front or using the Steffen Method, but none have proven to be optimal or widely implemented.|Boarding a plane is a nightmare . Heres how we got here|Y|We would like to begin boarding our flight at this time. You are familiar with that friendlyboardingannouncement from the gate agent . Unfortunately it means the next 45 minutes of your life will be messy . And airlines have made it chaotic by design  so people will pay to get an easier boarding process . First passengers begin to crowd the gate queue causing a bottleneck . Although you told yourself you would sit behind calmly in the waiting area at the airport until your zone was called you cant resist . You head over to the scrum . Next comes confusion about which zone passengers are assigned . Zone 1 or Group A dont actually mean we get to board first . People line up out of turn waiting for their group to be called . Some passengers cut the line to secure space for their carry-on bag in theoverhead bin . Finally your zone is called and you can scan your ticket and get on the plane . Dont get too excited though  the line on the jet idge is backed up . More waiting . Once you make it through the crawl on the jet idge andstep onto the plane its also backed up . Your seat is in the last section of the plane . You move in fits and starts jostling your way through the narrow aisle until youve reached the row . If youre lucky enough to find space for your carry-on bag in the overhead you awkwardly toss it in hoping not to hit another passenger in the process . Its still not over . You go to sit down in our window seat but someone is in the middle . They have to get out and move into the aisle holding up the line behind you . Boarding a plane is the 21st century version of Lord of the Flies  said Henry Harteveldt who covers the travel industry for Atmosphere Research Group . The airlines created this complexity and this insanity. Heres how it became so disorderly and why it isnt more efficient . That panic over faster boarding and the guarantee of an overhead compartment isnt a bug for the airlines . Its a feature . Sure airlines could make boarding better for everyone . But whats better for the airlines is to make boarding better only for some people . The people who want to give them even more money . Carriers recognized they could increase profits by charging a fee to travelers who want priority boarding . Theres internal tension between airline marketing teams that are focused on maximizing revenue from boarding and operations teams that want the process to run more efficiently said Robert Mann an airline consultant and former executive . Because theres so much money on the credit card and frequent flier side the marketing people win and the operations people have to deal with it  he said . Additionally planes have gotten larger and are more frequently booked up thanks to improvements in airline analytics . And some carriers have reduced the number of agents at the gate because more agents means more people the airlines have to pay . Despite various boarding strategies and techniques over the years from airlines the process is still a nightmare . Getting on a plane wasnt always this complicated . Decades ago airlines used to board first class and use an open boarding process for the main cabin . Passengers could check bags for free . But in 2008 amid soaring fuel prices airlinesbegan charging passengers for checked bags . Thats when things began to go off the rails  Harteveldt said . Passengers started to carry on more bags to avoid paying a fee or wait to pick up bags at their arrival . Airlines figured out they could make money off of bags . That killed any efficiency to do faster boarding  said Massoud Bazargan a professor at Emy-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach Florida who studies airline scheduling and operations . Last year airlines collected nearly $ 7 billion on bag fees according to the Transportation Department . In response airlines started sellingvaluable overhead bin spaceto travelers willing to pay for earlier boarding . Airlines also began dangling credit cards frequent flier programs andloyalty programsthey could all sell to people who wanted boarding priority  something that wasnt really necessary before with a system that mostly worked before the industry oke it . By 2012 carriers began introducing basic economy fares and offered priority boarding for a fee . All these newly created segments of passengers meant airlines needed to separate them during boarding . Companies introduced a new lingo of different boarding zones and groups slowing down the process . The more zones and groups of boarding the longer it takes  Bazargan said . Changes in the airline industry to improve airlines profitability have also impacted boarding . Aircraft have gotten larger and with denser cramped seatingto accommodate more travelers . Flights are also more frequently packed clogging up boarding . Last April passenger load factor  the ratio of passengers to seats available  was 84 a jump from 74 in 2000 according to the Transportation Department . Airlines have been experimenting with different boarding schemes to try to speed up the process . But none have found an optimal boarding method . Some airlines have tried to board passengers with window seats first followed by middle seats and then aisles  known as Wilma . But companies abandoned this method because it split up families and was chaotic for people boarding late . Boarding from the back to the front also hasnt gone smoothly . This method causes congestion in the aisle as people look for their seats and store their luggage in the overhead . Jason Steffen a University of Nevada Las Vegas physics professor developed a boarding method that boards passengers in rows of two . TheSteffen Methodallows several rows of passengers to store their luggage simultaneously and minimizes the time it takes to load luggage . This method can cut the boarding time by nearly half . But airlines have not implemented it . This method requires strict quality controls over where people stand in line and interferes with boarding strategies based on travelers status . If airlines wanted to speed up the boarding process they could make it free to check bags reduce the number of zones and switch to open seating . Southwest Airlines has the fastest boarding process of any major airline by simply allowing people to claim the first available seat . It works because passengers spend less time waiting in the aisle and have more freedom to sit where its least crowded . But airlines are unlikely to switch to Southwests model . They dont want to do random seating  Bazargan said . They would deprive themselves money from seat assignments.|Airlines|Transportation|CNN|Sep 16, 2023, 02:16 PM|Airlines have recognized the opportunity to increase profits by charging fees for priority boarding and checked bags, leading to tension between marketing teams focused on revenue and operations teams focused on efficiency.

The tests included operating the plane in temperatures as low as -28 degrees Celsius, thrust-reversed tests with snow, and a local flight test. These tests are necessary to ensure that new plane models can withstand extreme environmental conditions. Boeing chose the McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Florida as the location for extreme weather testing on their 787 Dreamliner. The aircraft was exposed to temperatures as low as -42.7 degrees Celsius and as high as 46 degrees Celsius for several hours. These tests help Boeing ensure that their airplanes can operate effectively in all climates and seasons. Airbus' cold weather testing in Iqaluit had to be cut short due to unexpectedly warm temperatures of -18 degrees Celsius. The tests were initially scheduled for five days but had to be shortened. This highlights the unpredictability of weather conditions and the challenges faced by aircraft manufacturers in conducting extreme weather trials.|Cold weather testing Airplanes endure punishing extremes|Y|Withextremely cold temperaturesgripping much of the United States travelers may be wondering how their planes are made safe for flying . The short answer Along with regular deicing of planes before take-off airlines put their aircraft through rigorous testing in some of the coldest places on the planet before they are ever pressed into service . CNN has previously followed a team of Airbus engineers mechanics and test pilots . Their mission was to see how their test plane a long-range A350 XWB withstood extreme cold . The Airbus team left the warmth and comfort of their Toulouse France base to perform various extreme-weather trials on the test plane in frigid Iqaluit the capital of Canadas eastern Arctic territory of Nunavut . The ground and in-air tests included operating the A350 XWB in temperatures reaching down to -18 Fahrenheit -28 degrees Celsius thrust-reversed tests with snow and a local flight test . All new plane models must be tested in extreme environmental conditions from freezing to intense heat . Coming to an extreme place means we can eak everything  Airbus head of flight operations Pedro Dias told local reporters . Extreme cold affects various parts of an aircraft in different ways . Metals such as steel and aluminum contract at different rates . Luicants may lose their viscosity creating friction and wear issues for moving parts . Meanwhile plastic and rubber parts could become ittle . The cold-weather tests in Canada came only days after the MSN3 test plane completed high-altitude test in Bolivia . Next stop was Qatar for hot-weather testing . For years Iqaluit located on Baffin Island has marketed itself as a premier cold-weather test site. Airbus has tested there since the 1990s while the airport has also hosted other civilian and military aircraft makers such as Boeing Dassault and Eurocopter to perform similar trials . But cold weather test sites also appear in unlikely places . In April 2010 Boeing chose McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Florida as the location for extreme-weather testing on its 787 Dreamliner . In a test chamber the aircraft was given a cold soak and exposed to temperatures as low as -45 degrees Fahrenheit -42.7 degrees Celsius for hours . Later it had to endure temperatures as high as 115 degrees Fahrenheit 46 degrees Celsius also for hours . These tests help us establish that our customers will get airplanes that work for them in all of the climates in which they operate around the globe and in all seasons  Randy Tinseth vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes said in a news release . But extreme-weather trials are also affected by unpredictability of Mother Nature . Initially scheduled for five days Airbus tests in Iqaluit were cut short not because of an impending winter blizzard but because of a balmy temperature of -18 degrees Celsius  too warm for the cold weather testing .|Airbus|Transportation|CNN|Feb 01, 2023, 07:48 AM|Airbus engineers conducted extreme cold weather testing on their A350 XWB plane in Iqaluit, Canada, operating the plane in temperatures as low as -28 degrees Celsius.
