Airbus|Airbus engineers, mechanics, and test pilots conducted extreme cold weather testing on their A350 XWB plane in Iqaluit, Canada. The tests included operating the plane in temperatures as low as -28 degrees Celsius, thrust-reversed tests with snow, and a local flight test. These tests are necessary to ensure that new plane models can withstand extreme environmental conditions. Boeing chose the McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Florida as the location for extreme weather testing on their 787 Dreamliner. The aircraft was exposed to temperatures as low as -42.7 degrees Celsius and as high as 46 degrees Celsius for several hours. These tests help Boeing ensure that their airplanes can operate effectively in all climates and seasons. Airbus' cold weather testing in Iqaluit had to be cut short due to unexpectedly warm temperatures of -18 degrees Celsius. The tests were initially scheduled for five days but had to be shortened. This highlights the unpredictability of weather conditions and the challenges faced by aircraft manufacturers in conducting extreme weather trials.| Airbus conducted extreme cold weather testing on their A350 XWB plane in Iqaluit, Canada .

Airlines|The government plans to improve transparency for online shoppers by cracking down on firms that add necessary charges at checkout, increasing the final price. A public consultation will be launched by the Department for Business and Trade to address this issue, which is estimated to cost consumers 1.6 billion annually. The practice of hidden fees is widespread across various industries, including airlines, transport providers, entertainment, and hospitality. Separate consultations have been launched to address the issues of fake reviews and confusing labels. The government aims to ensure that consumers have the clearest and most accurate information upfront before making a purchase. These consultations are part of the efforts to provide a crucial safety net for consumers and their cash while minimizing unnecessary burdens for businesses. Ancillary services, such as food and drink or cabin baggage, have become a significant part of airlines' business models, generating $103 billion globally in 2022. Airlines argue that unbundling these extras from the ticket price provides travelers with more choice and cheaper fares overall. However, there is a need for more clarity about final prices to benefit customers, especially in the context of the cost-of-living crisis. American Airlines has revised its earnings forecast for the third quarter, expecting adjusted earnings per share to be between 20 cents and 30 cents, down from a previous forecast of as much as 95 cents. The revision is attributed to higher fuel costs and a new pilot labor deal. The carrier also halved its operating margin forecast to 4 to 5. Spirit Airlines has reduced its revenue forecast for the third quarter and expects negative margins of as much as 15.5, down from an earlier estimate of -5.5 to -7.5. The airline, like others, is facing higher costs and a slower travel demand period. Shares of Spirit Airlines fell as a result of the announcement. Frontier Airlines has warned that recent sales have been below historical seasonality patterns and has forecasted an adjusted loss for the quarter. The airline's stock hit a new 52-week low. This comes as airlines, including Southwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines, have already cut their third-quarter forecasts. Many companies, including aerospace manufacturers and package delivery giant UPS, are warning that the surge in fuel costs and employee pay hikes will eat into their profits this quarter. Airlines, in particular, are being hit hard as their biggest expenses are jet fuel and labor. Delta Air Lines and American Airlines have both cut their earnings forecasts due to the increased costs of fuel and new labor deals. Labor unions across various industries, from the auto industry to Hollywood, are pushing for better compensation in new contracts. UPS and the Teamsters union recently reached a new labor deal that includes raises for both full- and part-time workers. The United Auto Workers and Detroit automakers are still far apart in talks for new labor deals, potentially leading to strategic strikes. Hollywood writers and actors have also gone on strike, demanding better pay to match changing industry dynamics. UPS recently outlined the costs associated with its new labor deal, stating that expenses derived from it will increase at a compound annual growth rate of 3.3% over the next five years. The company expects the costs to be $500 million more in the back half of 2023 than originally forecasted. This highlights the financial impact of labor deals on companies' expenses and profitability. According to a report from Hopper, airfare prices for early autumn are much lower than fares over the summer. Airlines are trying to boost demand during the off-peak season by offering lower prices. Prices to top international destinations, including Europe, are down 31% from summer peaks. Domestic airfare prices for September and October are averaging $211 per ticket, down 29% from average prices in June, July, and August. This drop in prices is typical during the fall shoulder season when demand cools off after the busy summer months. Airlines are slashing prices to incentivize travelers to book trips before the winter holidays. The Federal Reserve is projecting a travel slowdown this fall, as several of its regional districts reported peaking or slowing tourism activity. While international travel saw a surge this summer, the Fed expects a decrease in travel demand during the fall season. This projection aligns with the typical trend of reduced travel after the peak summer months. Frontier Airlines has flagged lower bookings in recent weeks, with sales trending below historical seasonality patterns. As a result, the airline is forecasting an adjusted loss for the quarter. This decrease in bookings could be attributed to the projected travel slowdown and rising fuel prices, which may impact ticket prices. American Airlines has reported a considerable increase in fuel prices since July, which may lead to higher ticket prices. The airline is currently paying about $3 per gallon for jet fuel. Additionally, oil prices surged 9.1% last month, according to the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index report, further contributing to the potential increase in ticket prices. Airlines recognized the opportunity to increase profits by charging a fee for priority boarding, creating internal tension between marketing teams focused on revenue and operations teams focused on efficiency. Airlines started charging fees for checked bags, leading to an increase in carry-on bags and a decrease in efficiency during boarding. Bag fees have become a significant source of revenue for airlines. To accommodate various passenger segments and sell priority boarding, airlines introduced different boarding zones and groups, resulting in a longer boarding process. Larger aircraft and higher passenger load factors have contributed to congestion during boarding, as more passengers need to find their seats and store their luggage. Airlines have tried different boarding methods, such as boarding from back to front or using the Steffen Method, but none have proven to be optimal or widely implemented.| A public consultation will be launched by the Department for Business and Trade to address this issue .

Amazon|Big-name employers like Amazon, Meta, and Merck are signaling that they will get tough on enforcing their return-to-office mandates after Labor Day. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned employees that non-compliance with the office attendance policy could impact their future at the company. Meta announced that employees assigned to an office must come in three days a week, with noncompliance potentially resulting in disciplinary action. Merck notified employees that office-based positions would require three days on-site, with consequences for non-attendance. According to security provider Kastle Systems, the average occupancy rate in office buildings in the 10 most populous US cities was 47.2% of pre-pandemic levels for the week between August 17 and August 23. This is an increase from the post-pandemic high of just over 50% in early June. Tuesday was the most popular day for employees to show up, with nearly 56% occupancy, while Friday had the lowest occupancy at 31%. A study by workplace analytics firm Basking found that the hours employees spend at work on the days they go into the office may be changing. In the first half of this year, only 55% of office visits on average lasted for more than 6 hours, compared to the pre-pandemic figure of 84%. This suggests a potential shift in work patterns and productivity during in-person office days. Surveys conducted by workplace consulting firms provide insights into the return-to-office policies and enforcement strategies of companies. A live poll survey by Gartner found that 45% of respondents ask employees to come to the office only a few days a week, while only 21% mandate return-to-office policies. Many companies do not have consequences for not meeting attendance requirements, but some enforce compliance through meetings, performance improvement plans, lower performance reviews, and reduced bonuses.| Amazon, Meta, and Merck are signaling that they will enforce their return-to-office mandates after Labor Day .

American Airlines|American Airlines announced that rising costs, including fuel prices and a new pilot contract, will significantly impact its upcoming profits. The airline now expects adjusted earnings per share to be between 20 cents to 30 cents in the third quarter, compared to the previous forecast of 95 cents per share. Discount carrier Spirit Airlines reduced its third-quarter revenue forecast by 5% due to rising fuel prices and increased promotional activity with steep discounting. The adjusted guidance was attributed to travel bookings for the weeks leading into Thanksgiving weekend. Shares of American Airlines and Spirit Airlines fell approximately 3% in premarket trading. According to a forecast from the International Air Transport Association, global airlines are expected to make nearly $10 billion in profit this year as business bounces back from the pandemic. The organization more than doubled its 2023 profit forecast for the industry, with airlines projected to make $9.8 billion in net profit in 2023, up from a previous forecast of $4.7 billion.| American Airlines now expects adjusted earnings per share to be between 20 cents to 30 cents in the third quarter .

Anheuser-Busch|The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust purchased 1.7 million shares of Anheuser-Busch valued at around $95 million. This investment indicates that Bill Gates has confidence in the beer company, despite its steep sales slump and recent controversies surrounding Bud Light's partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Since Bill Gates' purchase, Anheuser-Busch's stock has declined nearly 2% and is down about 7% for the year. The company reported a 10% decline in US revenue in the second quarter, primarily due to falling Bud Light sales. The decline in sales was isolated to the United States, as revenue in Canada actually rose. Modelo, a beer brand, overtook Bud Light in sales at grocery and beer stores. This marks the first time Modelo has beaten Bud Light on a year-to-date basis. However, the difference in market share is slim, with Modelo holding 8.34% of dollars spent on beer compared to Bud Light's 8.28%. Anheuser-Busch announced layoffs affecting approximately 380 positions within its US employee population. This decision was made as the company continues to face challenges in its sales and revenue, particularly with the decline in Bud Light sales. In addition to Anheuser-Busch, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust also purchased nearly $1 billion worth of shares of Heineken Holding, the parent company of the Dutch beer. This suggests that Bill Gates has invested in the beer industry beyond just Anheuser-Busch.| Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust purchased 1.7 million shares of Anheuser-Busch valued at around $95 million .

Apple|Apple is betting on a trade-in programme to drive India sales of its newly launched iPhone 15 series as well as the previous-generation iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. The company will popularize the trade-in or 'phone exchange programme in India through marketing campaigns and highlighting it on its India website. The trade-in programme offers trade-in values for older iPhones, making it attractive for young aspirational buyers looking to reduce the upfront cost of purchasing iPhones. Apple has reduced the prices of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus after the launch of their successors. The reduced prices, along with discounts offered by channels, are expected to drive sales of these smartphones in India. Counterpoint Research estimates that the iPhone 14 will capture more than 50% of the sales in India this year. Apple is expected to sell a record over 9 million iPhones in India this year, with its highest-ever market share of 5%. This growth is attributed to the trade-in programme, reduced prices of older models, and the extensive portfolio of iPhones available in the market. Apple manufactures iPhones in India and offers a recycling service through the trade-in programme. The price difference of over Rs 35,000 for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models in India compared to other countries is leading to direct imports by holidaying consumers and increased demand in the grey market. Traders in grey market hubs like Delhi's Gaffar Market have started taking advance bookings with a promise of lower prices. The high price arbitrage may lead to more sales through grey markets and consumers purchasing units when they travel abroad. Increasing currency arbitrage between the dollar and the rupee and the customs duty of 22% on the Pro models, which are not made in India, are the leading causes for the steep price hikes in India. Dubai has become a preferred destination for purchasing iPhones due to the lower prices. Social media is filled with posts on how consumers buying iPhone 15 Pro series models in Dubai can recover the cost of travel with the savings. Apple has introduced more differentiation in the Pro models with industry-first features like the 3nm Apple A17 chip, titanium frame, faster data transfer speeds, and improved cameras. The Pro models are expected to benefit from the premiumization trend in India, especially among consumers who consider their phones as lifestyle statements and content creators. Apple's market share in India is expected to increase to 6-7% with a record shipment of 8-9 million units in 2023. The base model of the iPhone 15 is being made in India by Apple's contract manufacturer Foxconn and is expected to be available locally on the first day of sale. The Dynamic Island OLED display and 48MP cameras make the base model more popular this time, appealing to upgraders and switchers. However, customers may not see any tangible benefits of the model being made locally as Apple is expected to use the cost differential for channel expansion and marketing. Instead of reducing prices, Apple is expected to use the cost differential for channel expansion and marketing its new products at a larger scale in India. The previous generation iPhone models are still expected to garner a significant portion of Apple's sales in the coming quarters. Apple has been investing in building out the channel and direct-to-consumer offers, with the performance of its stores in Mumbai and Delhi exceeding expectations. Apple is planning to launch the iPhone 15, manufactured in Foxconn's Chennai unit, in India in mid-September, just a few days after the global launch. Last year, it took around a month for made-in-India iPhones to reach the market, but this year the lag is expected to be only a few days. Apple aims to initially cater to the local market and then start exporting the India-made devices, including to Europe and the US. Apple has been leading the way in driving mobile phone exports from India and has become the flagbearer of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for smartphones. Its contract manufacturers, Foxconn, Hon Hai, Wistron, and Pegatron, have committed to exports of Rs 61,000 crore in FY24. In the June quarter of FY24, iPhone exports from India crossed Rs 20,000 crore, constituting 35% of all electronics exports and 66% of total mobile exports. India's PLI scheme, launched when US-China tensions were high, has successfully attracted companies like Apple to manufacture locally. In 2022-23, Apple manufactured over $7.5 billion worth of iPhones in India, making it the largest mobile phone exporter from the country. This surge in iPhone exports has propelled electronics to become the fourth-largest exported item from India in the June quarter of FY24. The prices of iPhone 15 in India are significantly higher compared to the US and Dubai, even though some of these iPhones are manufactured within the country. The iPhone 15 Pro Max 1 terabyte is priced at Rs 1,99,900 in India, marking a 51% increase when compared to the US price of $1,599. The base variant of the iPhone 15 Pro is priced at Rs 1,34,900 in India compared to Rs 82,917 in the US. Several factors contribute to the price disparities of iPhones in India. One reason is the supply chain, as several components are shipped after the payment of import duty. Additionally, the scale of business in India is much less compared to the US and Dubai. Apple collaborates with partners to offer discounts and trade-in options to mitigate the impact of customs duties and taxes on the final pricing of imported models. Apple's initial focus in India remains on the previous-generation models, allowing consumers to warm up to the new ones gradually. Older generation iPhones are propelling Apple's growth in India. The company plans to invest in marketing, supply chain, and affordability offers for previous-gen iPhone models, which contribute to the majority of volumes in India. The pre-orders for the new Apple iPhone 15 series, Watch Series 9, and AirPods Pro 2nd-Gen have started in India. These devices will be available in the country from September 22, along with other global markets. The 'Make in India' iPhone 15 will be available on the same day as the global sales. The new iPhone 15 series, including iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, will be available in India. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus come in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display sizes, with various color options and storage capacities. The Apple Watch Series 9 is also available for pre-order in different sizes and case materials. The iPhone 15 starts at Rs 79,900, while the iPhone 15 Plus starts at Rs 89,900. The iPhone 15 Pro starts at Rs 134,900, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at Rs 159,900. The Apple Watch Series 9 starts at Rs 41,900, and the Apple Watch SE starts at Rs 29,900. The AirPods Pro 2nd-Gen with MagSafe Charging Case can be pre-ordered for Rs 24,900. Imran Chaudhri, a top software designer at Apple, wrote a farewell email to colleagues announcing his planned exit. The email alarmed Apple's bosses, who feared that it could be interpreted as a sign that Apple's best days had passed. As a result, Chaudhri was fired and did not receive his shares. The recent launch of iPhone15 left many Apple fans disappointed, as they felt it lacked innovation compared to previous iPhones. Despite Apple's description of the launch as a huge leap forward, with new design features and a 48MP main camera, many fans believe it failed to stand apart from its predecessors. After the death of Steve Jobs, Apple's focus shifted from innovation to business growth under CEO Tim Cook. This led to the departure of key designers, such as Jony Ive, and a decline in inspired creativity. Many argue that the decade from 2001 to 2010 was the era of innovation at Apple, while the following decade saw a lack of breakthrough products. Shares in Apple have fallen for a second day in a row after reports that Chinese government workers have been banned from using iPhones. China is Apple's third-largest market, accounting for 18% of its total revenue last year. The ban may also be imposed on workers at state-owned companies and government-backed agencies. Apple's stock market valuation has fallen by more than 6% or almost $200 billion in the past two days due to the reports of the Chinese government ban on iPhones. This decline in valuation reflects the impact of losing a significant market and potential sales in China, which is one of Apple's biggest markets. Tensions between the US and China over technology have been rising steadily, with both parties imposing restrictions. This year, Washington, along with its allies Japan and the Netherlands, restricted China's access to some chip technology. China retaliated by restricting exports of two materials key to the semiconductor industry. Apple's upcoming iPhone, set to be unveiled on 12 September, is expected to feature a USB-C charge point. This move comes in response to a European Union law that requires phone manufacturers to adopt a common charging connection by December 2024. The switch to USB-C will allow customers to use a single charger for iPads, Macs, and iPhones, and also offer faster download speeds. The European Union has set a deadline of Christmas 2024 for phone manufacturers to adopt a common charging connection. This move aims to save consumers up to 250 million a year on unnecessary charger purchases and reduce electronic waste by 11,000 tonnes per year. The EU common-charger rule will cover a range of small and medium-sized portable electronics. The suicide of a teacher in South Korea has brought attention to the issue of parent bullying in the country's education system. The teacher had been facing relentless harassment from parents, highlighting the intense pressure and high expectations placed on educators. This incident has sparked a national conversation about the need to address parent bullying and support teachers. France has ordered Apple to stop selling the iPhone 12 due to excessive electromagnetic radiation. The French watchdog governing radio frequencies has also instructed Apple to fix existing phones. If the issue cannot be resolved through a software update, Apple may have to recall all iPhone 12 devices sold in the country. Apple is contesting the French watchdog's review and has provided lab results from the company itself and third parties to show that the iPhone 12 complies with all relevant regulations on radiation levels. The company states that the iPhone 12 is recognized as being compliant worldwide. Apple has two weeks to respond to the decision. France will share its findings with other regulators in the trading bloc, potentially leading to a snowball effect. The decision to recall iPhone 12 devices in France could influence other countries to take similar actions. The French digital minister has stated that if Apple fails to respond, a recall of all iPhone 12 devices in circulation may be ordered. Apple will deliver a software update for iPhone 12 users in France after sales were halted due to concerns about electromagnetic radiation. The update will only apply to users in France, where a specific testing protocol exists. The radio frequency regulator ANFR will test the update for compliance before allowing iPhone 12 back on sale in the country. Apple is contesting the review conducted by the French regulator ANFR regarding the radiation levels of iPhone 12. The company claims that the device is compliant with emissions rules worldwide and has provided lab results to support its stance. However, the regulator has given Apple a two-week deadline to resolve the issue. Regulators from Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany are now looking into the iPhone 12 radiation issue following the French ban. The German network agency BNetzA stated that the French investigation could lead to measures applicable to all EU member states. The UK and US have not announced any action in response to the French ban. Several European countries, including France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany, are examining concerns over the iPhone 12 emitting excessive electromagnetic radiation. France has ordered Apple to stop sales and given the company two weeks to respond to its probe. The findings will be shared with regulators in other EU member states, and the investigation could lead to Europe-wide measures. The Belgian government has instructed its regulator to review whether the iPhone 12 poses health risks. The state secretary for digitalisation has emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety and protection of all citizens. The regulator will examine all Apple models, followed by other brands. Based on the French tests, the Dutch digital infrastructure agency has confirmed that radiation levels on the iPhone 12 have been exceeded. The agency will contact Apple, but states that there is no acute safety risk. The German network agency also highlights that the French investigation could lead to measures applicable to all EU member states. Apple has a strict culture and focus, which is why it rarely buys name-and companies. Its largest takeover was the $3 billion deal for Beats Electronics in 2014. Unlike Microsoft, which has acquired several companies for billions of dollars, mergers and acquisitions are not in Apple's DNA. For years, there has been speculation about Apple potentially buying Disney, a company with a market valuation of nearly $150 billion. The ties between the two companies are historically strong, with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs becoming Disney's largest individual shareholder after Disney acquired Pixar, owned by Jobs, for $7.4 billion in 2006. However, it is unclear if Apple would have any interest in buying Disney, as it has no core competency in running theme parks or selling consumer products like Disney does. Even if Apple were to consider buying Disney, merging the two distinct and well-established cultures could be a potential recipe for disaster. The Bob Chapek era at Disney has shown the difficulty of changing employee attitudes and expectations, even for someone with three decades of experience at the company. Large media mergers in the past have often resulted in value destruction, making the blending of Apple and Disney's cultures a challenging task. Apple is holding its most important launch event of the year, where it is expected to unveil new hardware, including the iPhone 15. The event will be presented through a prerecorded video featuring company executives and will be streamed on YouTube and Apple's website. Apple's launches are crucial for the company as they build hype for the products and set the stage for a marketing blitz. Apple is expected to release four new iPhone models, continuing the pattern that has been in place since 2020. The models are likely to include two sizes of middle-range iPhones and two sizes of higher-end 'Pro' phones with titanium casing and better cameras. The biggest change expected is the introduction of a USB-C charging port, replacing Apple's proprietary Lightning port. Apple is likely to update its Apple Watch Series and accessories. The new watches may feature upgraded chips and health sensors, while the accessories may be updated to work with USB-C. Additionally, the AirPods Pro will receive a new feature called Adaptive Audio, which intelligently adjusts volume and noise-canceling to allow users to be aware of their surroundings. China has banned the use of iPhones for central government officials, according to The Wall Street Journal. The ban was reportedly communicated to staff through chat groups or meetings. This move could be seen as retaliation for similar actions taken by the US against Chinese tech companies, and it may have a negative impact on Apple and other foreign companies with a presence in China. Even before the formal ban, Chinese officials had been following an unwritten rule of avoiding iPhones for months, as reported by a source familiar with Chinese central government agencies. This suggests that the ban is not entirely surprising and may have been in effect unofficially. The sensitivity of the subject is evident from the source's request to remain anonymous. The ban on iPhones for Chinese government officials could be seen as a response to the US restrictions imposed on Chinese tech companies. Both Huawei and ZTE have faced limitations in the US, and in November 2022, the Biden administration banned approvals of new telecommunications equipment from these companies due to national security concerns. The ban on TikTok by multiple US institutions further highlights the ongoing tensions between the two countries. Apple is set to unveil the iPhone 15, which is expected to come with a significant change - the switch from Apple's proprietary Lightning charger to USB-C charging. This move marks a milestone for the company in adopting universal charging and streamlining the charging process across various devices. The switch is in compliance with the European Union's legislation requiring smartphones and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024. Although Apple has previously switched its iPads and MacBooks to USB-C charging, the company has been resistant to making the change on the iPhone. Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Greg Joswiak, expressed the value and ubiquity of the Lightning charger but acknowledged the need to comply with the EU mandate. The shift to USB-C could generate more e-waste in the short term as people phase out their Lightning cables. Apple has financial reasons for pushing back on the switch to USB-C. The company makes money from selling Lightning cables and accessories, as well as taking a cut from third-party accessories through its Made For iPhone program. Moving to USB-C would reduce Apple's control over its ecosystem, as USB-C is a more open ecosystem. However, Apple could create its own branded USB-C cable to optimize performance and minimize risk and damage to batteries. The shift to USB-C may not be a sole incentive for people to upgrade to the iPhone 15, but it could sway some consumers who have been resistant due to charging limitations. The devices are expected to ship with a new cable in the box, and considering the widespread use of USB-C in other devices, access to charging wires should not be difficult or costly. In the long term, the switch to USB-C is likely to benefit consumers with a universal charging system. While Apple could bypass wired charging altogether to make way for wireless charging, it is unlikely to happen soon due to the slower speed of wireless charging compared to wired charging. The future possibility of wireless charging remains uncertain.

The shift to USB-C on the iPhone is seen as a disruption to iPhone design but not a dramatic move. Apple's resistance to the switch from Lightning to USB-C charging on the iPhone is partly driven by financial reasons. Apple makes money from selling Lightning cables and accessories, as well as taking a cut from third-party accessories through its Made For iPhone program. Additionally, the switch could generate e-waste in the short term as people phase out their Lightning cables. Apple may need to develop a Lightning cable recycling program.

While Apple could potentially bypass wired charging altogether and adopt wireless charging, it is unlikely to happen soon due to the slower speed of wireless charging compared to wired charging. The future adoption of wireless charging remains uncertain. Apple unveiled its iPhone 15 lineup and major updates during its September keynote event. The company announced that it will switch to USB-C charging from its proprietary Lightning charging cable, aiming to streamline the charging process across various devices. The iPhone 15 lineup also includes design changes, camera system improvements, and the adoption of universal charging. Apple introduced the new Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches during its event. The Series 9 features Apples in-house silicon chip and ultrawideband connectivity, while the Ultra 2 comes with the updated S9 custom chip and a new UWB chip. Both smartwatches offer new features and colors, and customers can place orders starting today. Perhaps the biggest change coming to the iPhone 15 models is the switch to USB-C charging, ending an 11-year run with Apple's proprietary Lightning charging cable. This change allows Apple customers to use the same USB-C chargers for their iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers, simplifying the charging process. The switch aligns with the European Union's legislation to require USB-C charging support by 2024. Apple is finally abandoning its proprietary Lightning port in the iPhone 15 and adopting a charging cable that is compatible with non-Apple products. This move, prompted by a European regulatory mandate, is largely symbolic as most other gadgets have already switched to USB-C. While it may not significantly reduce e-waste, it is an important step towards creating a common charger across devices and raising awareness about the issue. Retiring the Lightning cable could potentially lead to a surge of e-waste in the short term as iPhone users discard their useless cables. However, the overall impact on global e-waste is expected to be minimal, as charging cables account for only a few hundred thousand tons out of the 66 million tons of electronic waste generated each year. Nevertheless, this transition is an important step in addressing the growing e-waste problem and making people aware of the issue. E-waste is a growing problem that often ends up in closets and junk drawers instead of being properly treated. This leads to the need for more mining of materials like copper, gold, and platinum to produce new products. While the EU rule may not directly reduce waste, it can encourage manufacturers like Apple to make it easier to refurbish and recycle old products, ultimately helping to close the loop and promote reuse over recycling. Apple announced at its iPhone 15 event that all of its next-generation smartphones will launch with USB-C charging, marking a milestone moment for the company. This move comes after years of resistance from Apple to switch from its proprietary Lightning charger. The switch to USB-C will make charging easier for customers and aligns with the European Union's legislation requiring devices to support USB-C charging by 2024. With the adoption of USB-C charging, Apple customers can now use the same USB-C chargers to power their iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. This eliminates the need to find the right charger for each device and allows for charging between devices. The switch to USB-C charging is a significant disruption to iPhone design and provides convenience and compatibility for Apple users. While Apple has financial reasons for resisting the switch to USB-C charging, such as revenue from selling Lightning cables and accessories, the company is complying with the European Union's mandate. The move to USB-C also aligns with environmental efforts to tackle e-waste. Apple is selling a USB-C to Lightning adapter to connect existing Lightning accessories to USB-C-enabled devices, and it has a recycling program for used chargers and cables. Apple plans to issue a software update for iPhone 12 users in France to accommodate the protocol used by French regulators. This comes after France's National Frequency Agency (ANFR) ordered the immediate withdrawal of iPhone 12 from the market, citing that it exceeded European radiation exposure limits. Apple clarified that the suspension of sales was due to a specific testing protocol and not a safety concern. France's National Frequency Agency (ANFR) ordered the immediate withdrawal of iPhone 12 from the French market, stating that it exceeded European radiation exposure limits. The ANFR also ruled that Apple must take necessary corrective measures to bring the already in-use iPhone 12 devices into conformity or recall them. The suspension of sales was related to a specific testing protocol used by French regulators. Apple has assured France's minister for the digital economy that it will be rolling out a software update for iPhone 12 in the next few days. This update is aimed at bringing the model in line with the European standards applied in France, as requested by the ANFR. Once the update is tested and approved, Apple will be able to resume sales of iPhone 12 in France. On the same day as the sales suspension of iPhone 12 in France, Apple unveiled its newest iterations, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro, at its annual keynote event in California. These new models are the latest additions to Apple's iconic product line.| Apple is betting on a trade-in programme to drive India sales of its iPhone 15 series as well as the previous-generation iPhone 14 and 14 Plus .

Apple Inc.|The pre-order sales for Apple's new flagship device, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, quickly saw delivery times slip into October, indicating strong demand for the most expensive model. The Pro Max, starting at $1,199, experienced delays in its first deliveries, with timelines pushed back from September 22 to as late as October 16. The delayed timelines affected all colors and most storage capacities of the model. While many of Apple's retail stores in the US still have day one availability for in-store pick up, the delayed timelines for iPhone 15 Pro Max are impacting home deliveries. Additionally, China is already experiencing shipment delays of four to five weeks for the Pro Max model. These delays suggest high demand and popularity for the new iPhone. The standard iPhone 15 Pro, with a smaller screen, is experiencing limited delays, primarily affecting the natural titanium model in some storage capacities. However, the lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models are not showing any immediate delays on Apple's website. This indicates that the delays are specific to the higher-end models.| iPhone 15 Pro Max pre-order sales for Apple's new flagship device quickly saw delivery times slip into October .

Auburn Manufacturing|President Joe Biden visited Auburn Manufacturing, a specialized textiles maker in Maine, to tout the success of his economic agenda. He highlighted the rising investments in construction projects by manufacturers as evidence of the growth in blue-collar work. This visit showcased the administration's focus on supporting manufacturing and boosting the economy. The Federal Reserve approved raising interest rates to their highest level in over 22 years, continuing their aggressive inflation-busting campaign. Economists are uncertain about the impact of these rate hikes on the economy. While the fiscal support provided by recent spending packages has boosted manufacturing, the rate hikes could potentially weigh on the industry. The injection of federal funds, including the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the CHIPS and Science Act, has allowed manufacturers to plan new factories and ramp up production. Additionally, the country's ongoing shift towards renewable energy has sparked a manufacturing boom in the United States. Economists estimate that the industry could add 250,000 jobs over the next two years. Despite the optimism among US consumers, business surveys indicate that the manufacturing sector has been contracting for several months. Weakening consumer demand, shrinking backlogs, and difficulties in hiring have contributed to this contraction. While manufacturers have increased spending on building factories, the short-term outlook remains uncertain, especially for manufacturers not directly benefiting from federal funds.| President Joe Biden visited Auburn Manufacturing in Maine to tout the success of his economic agenda .

Birmingham City Council|Birmingham City Council, Britain's second-biggest city, declared itself effectively bankrupt after being issued with equal pay claims totaling up to 760 million ($954 million). The council filed a Section 114 notice, halting all nonessential spending except on essential services. The deficit arose due to difficulties paying between 650 million ($816 million) and 760 million ($954 million) in equal pay claims. Birmingham City Council is facing significant financial challenges, including the council's historic equal pay liability concerns and the impact of funding reductions by successive Conservative governments. The council expects to have a deficit of 87 million ($109 million) for the 2023-24 financial year. Despite the challenges, the city remains open for business. The UK government stated that it is the responsibility of locally elected councils to manage their own budgets. However, the government has expressed concern about the governance arrangements of Birmingham City Council and has requested assurances about the best use of taxpayers' money. The council's leader, John Cotton, mentioned implementing a new jobs model to tackle the equal pay claims bill. Birmingham City Council, the biggest British city after London, is facing financial difficulties due to insufficient funds. The council has had to make spending cuts and issue a section 114 notice, halting all spending except on essential services. The financial troubles are partly attributed to hefty compensation claims it has had to pay former female employees who were historically paid less than men for similar work. Birmingham City Council is facing a significant financial challenge due to an outstanding legal bill of PS760 million ($950 million) related to equal pay claims. The council has already spent PS1.1 billion ($1.4 billion) over the past decade to settle these claims and expects a budget deficit of PS87 million ($109 million) for the next financial year. The council will need to reprioritize spending and allocate fewer resources in the future. Local councils in the UK, including Birmingham City Council, are experiencing a funding shortfall due to deep cuts in central government spending over the past decade. The government funding to local authorities in England dropped by more than 50% between 2010-11 and 2020-21. Many councils are concerned about the risk of bankruptcy and urge the government to come up with a long-term plan to sufficiently fund local services.| Birmingham City Council declared itself effectively bankrupt after being issued with equal pay claims totaling up to 760 million ($954 million) The council filed a Section 114 notice, halting all nonessential spending except on essential services .

British American Tobacco|British American Tobacco (BAT) has finalized its exit from Russia, selling its Russian and Belarusian businesses in compliance with local and international laws. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the transaction is expected to be completed within a month. BAT will no longer have a presence in Russia or Belarus and will receive no financial gain from ongoing sales in these markets. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, many companies, including Apple, McDonald's, and Coca-Cola, have pulled out of Russia. However, other global tobacco giants, such as Japan Tobacco International and Philip Morris International, are still doing business in the country. BAT's exit from Russia is another example of the impact of geopolitical events on multinational companies' operations. The buyer of BAT's Russian and Belarusian businesses is a consortium led by members of BAT Russia's management team. After the deal closes, the businesses will be known as the ITMS Group.

C16 Biosciences|C16 Biosciences, a US tech firm, has commercially released an alternative to palm oil that is created from yeast cells. The demand for palm oil has led to significant deforestation, and C16 Biosciences aims to reduce the world's reliance on palm oil with their product called Palmless. The yeast is fed on sugars from sugar cane plants, and the process takes less than seven days from start to finish. Palm oil remains the most-produced vegetable oil in the world, accounting for 40% of the total. It is widely used in food and cosmetics due to its smooth texture, natural preservative properties, and ability to maintain its properties under high temperatures. Oil palms produce significantly more oil per hectare compared to other oil crops, making palm oil very productive. Another team led by Professor Chris Chuck at the University of Bath has developed a yeast-sourced alternative to palm oil. The team created a unique strain of yeast called Metschnikowia pulcherrima (MP) that is hardy, can be fed on grass and food waste, and produces high oil yields. The aim is for the oil to be as sustainable as possible, with lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to palm oil.| US firm C16 Biosciences has developed yeast-sourced alternative to palm oil .

Cameo|Since the SAG-AFTRA strike began, over 2,400 performers have joined or reactivated their Cameo accounts, the biggest influx since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many out-of-work actors are turning to Cameo to earn income from fans who buy personalized celebrity videos, bridging the gap in their livelihoods. Several notable unionized stars, including Alyssa Milano, Cheyenne Jackson, Chris Wood, China McClain, and Melissa Benoist, have recently reactivated their Cameo accounts. These actors are using Cameo to connect with fans and earn extra income during the industry slowdown caused by the strike. Actors who have joined Cameo have earned anywhere from $5 to $25,000 through the platform. For actors like Fred Stoller, Cameo appearances provide additional income during slower seasons and allow them to interact with fans. Cameo has also changed the way fans view celebrities, offering a more accessible and personal connection.| Since the SAG-AFTRA strike began, over 2,400 performers have joined or reactivated their Cameo accounts .

Chevron|Strike action has begun at Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone plants in Western Australia, leading to a jump in natural gas prices. The walkouts are due to a dispute over pay and conditions. These two plants account for over 5% of global LNG capacity. The Fair Work Commission in Australia has been hosting mediation talks between Chevron and the Offshore Alliance, a partnership of two unions representing energy workers. However, after numerous meetings and conciliation sessions, the two parties remain apart on key terms. Oil prices have risen this week, with Brent crude trading at around $90 a barrel. This increase is attributed to Saudi Arabia and Russia extending their cuts to oil supplies until the end of the year. Workers at Chevron's liquified natural gas facilities in Australia have begun to walk off the job in a dispute over pay and other issues. The Australian Offshore Alliance, representing 500 workers at the Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities, described Chevron's bargaining performance as the most inept effort of any employer in the past 5 years. The industrial action, including work stoppages, has begun and could potentially impact up to 7% of global LNG supplies. News of the breakdown in talks between Chevron and the workers' union has led to a rise in European natural gas prices. Dutch gas futures, which serve as a benchmark for the region, climbed 9.8% on Friday. Europe has become more dependent on global LNG supplies since deliveries of pipeline gas from Russia slumped, and a prolonged disruption to global supplies could further push up prices. The drawn-out dispute at Chevron's LNG facilities in Australia could have significant implications for global LNG supply and competition. The two Chevron sites account for approximately 6% of global supply, and if strikes were to stop production for a month, around 7% of global supply would be wiped out. This could lead to increased competition for shipments, potentially affecting buyers in Asia and driving up prices.| Strike action has begun at Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone plants in Western Australia .

China|China has curbed exports of urea, a key fertilizer, following a price surge. China is the world's largest producer of urea and accounts for about a third of global supplies. As a result, around half a million metric tons of urea are held up at Chinese ports, causing delays in loading and inspections. Two Chinese state-owned urea producers have announced that they will prioritize domestic supply. This move further exacerbates the delay in urea shipments and inspections. The Chinese government has not provided any immediate comment on the situation. Around half a million metric tons of urea bought by Indian Potash Limited (IPL) are currently held at the Chinese port of Tianjin awaiting inspections and clearance. The loading process has been unusually delayed due to inspections. Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Limited (RCF) of India may also struggle to secure large purchases of over one million tons in a recently issued tender. CNAMPGC Holding Ltd, one of China's top fertilizer exporters, has announced proactive measures to decrease urea exports and ensure domestic supply and price stability. Additionally, China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) has urged its subsidiaries to prioritize urea supply to the domestic market. These actions have caused a decline in China's urea futures and are expected to raise global prices and increase India's spending on fertilizers. India, which imports about 30% of its annual urea requirement, is seeking alternative suppliers due to the curbs on urea exports from China. Supplies from Oman, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Russia are expected to fill the gap left by China, which was India's second-largest supplier last year. China has implemented a new set of stimulus measures to boost the property market and support the weakening yuan. The measures include reducing minimum down payments for mortgages, slashing interest rates on new mortgages, and allowing renegotiation of rates on existing mortgages. This move is expected to benefit 40 million home buyers and impact 25 trillion yuan ($3.5 trillion) in mortgages. After the announcement of the new stimulus measures, several major commercial banks in China, including ICBC, China Construction Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China, have cut their deposit rates. This coordinated move is intended to pave the way for banks to lower their mortgage rates based on the regulators' new requirements. Nomura analysts believe that this action will help boost confidence in the housing market. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has decided to reduce the amount of foreign currency that banks must hold as reserves. This move is aimed at alleviating the pressure on the yuan, which has been falling rapidly in recent months. While the amount may be insignificant, it symbolizes the PBOC's commitment to curb the yuan's weakness. The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for China unexpectedly swung back to expansion in August. The index rose to 51, the highest level since February, indicating a notable improvement in factory activity. This data suggests that the Chinese economy is showing signs of stabilization, although the official government survey still indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector. Data released in August suggests that the downturn in growth in China may be stabilizing. Industrial production rose 4.5% in August compared to a year earlier, and retail sales expanded by 4.6% from a year earlier. Despite the ongoing property crisis, there is optimism that the worst may be over for the Chinese economy. Sino-Ocean, a major state-backed property developer, announced that it would suspend repayments on its offshore borrowings, indicating the ongoing property crisis could continue to impact economic expansion. Property investment fell 8.8% in the first eight months of the year, and property sales by floor area dropped 7.1%. Moody's downgraded its outlook for the real estate sector. The Chinese government has introduced a flurry of measures to reignite growth, including a surprise cut to the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 25 basis points for all banks. This move aims to support economic recovery and improve liquidity in the financial system. However, caution is advised as it is still early in the process, and a single month of positive data is not sufficient to confirm a sustained path to recovery.| China is the world's largest producer of urea and accounts for about a third of global supplies .

Cipla|US buyout group Bain Capital has approached Dr Reddys Laboratories to explore a joint bid to buy out the promoters of Cipla, the Hamied family. The two sides have met to discuss and formalize a strategy. If successful, the combined entity would become the leading Indian-origin pharma major at home and in the US and emerging markets. Torrent Pharma, a sole Indian strategic investor, has submitted a non-binding bid for the Hamied family's stake in Cipla, competing against private equity firms Blackstone and Baring Private Equity Asia-EQT. Bain Capital, one of the private equity funds that Torrent has been in discussions with, is also considering a bid. The participation of Dr Reddys Laboratories in the bidding process would enhance the competitive landscape. Cipla and Dr Reddys have complementary strengths in geographical coverage, with Cipla dominant in India, West Asia, and South Africa, while Dr Reddys has historical strengths in the US and Russia. The merger would create a leading Indian pharma major with minimal product and segment overlap. Analysts estimate that the combined entity could generate a profit after tax of C/19,000 crore in the next year.| US buyout group Bain Capital has approached Dr Reddys Laboratories to explore a joint bid to buy out the promoters of Cipla, the Hamied family .

Citigroup|Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser announced a corporate reorganization, which will involve cutting down management layers and accelerating decisions. The firm will be divided into five main business lines that report directly to Fraser, eliminating unnecessary complexity and increasing accountability. The changes will also include job cuts, although the exact number has not been decided yet. Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has struggled in the post-2008 financial crisis era due to its smaller domestic retail banking presence compared to its competitors. The persistent stock slump and tensions between managers in the previous corporate structure have hindered new initiatives. The reorganization aims to revitalize the firm and deliver on medium-term targets. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser consolidated management of non-U.S. businesses under Ernesto Torres Canto. Despite exiting more than a dozen markets, including Mexico, Citigroup's stock has declined about 40% since Fraser took over in March 2021, the worst showing among her big bank rivals. The stock is currently trading at levels seen during the 2008 crisis. Citigroup's staff levels have grown as the firm complies with regulators' demands to improve risk controls. However, amid a slump in Wall Street activity, some rivals have been eliminating jobs. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser addressed the coming job cuts, acknowledging the contributions of the affected colleagues and stating that the reorganization will be completed by the first quarter of next year.| Citigroup will be divided into five main business lines that report directly to CEO Jane Fraser .

Corite|Electronic music artist Alan Walker has given around 8,000 fans the opportunity to invest in four of his singles, sharing his streaming revenues with them. He used the Swedish website and app called Corite to facilitate this, which handles all the financial details. This move allows Walker to involve his fans beyond just connecting with them through his music and stage performances. Corite, a Swedish website and app, allows up and coming artists to secure financial backing from their fanbase. Artists can announce campaigns for forthcoming releases and detail the amount of money they are seeking to raise. In return, fans can hope to earn more money than the sum they have invested, with rates of return typically between 1.4 and 1.7 times the investment amount. Despite the rise of streaming services and platforms like Corite, record labels still have an important role to play in the music industry. They have access to considerable capital, funding, marketing muscle, and media exposure, which can help artists be successful. While platforms like Corite offer artists a cheaper way of funding their careers, record labels provide support and resources that can be difficult to replicate independently.| Alan Walker has given around 8,000 fans the chance to invest in four of his singles .

Cox Automotive|Cox Automotive reported that wholesale used vehicle prices increased in August for the first time since March. The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index was 212.2 in August, up 0.2 from July. This marks the lowest increase in the index this year, indicating a potential bottoming out of prices for the year. Traditionally, retail prices for consumers follow changes in wholesale prices. With the recent increase in wholesale used vehicle prices, it is expected that retail prices will also see a similar trend. However, the tight inventories and expected sales levels are likely to prevent any substantial pricing declines. Cox estimates that used vehicle retail sales in August were up 5% compared to July. Year over year, they were up 0.8%. Despite the increase in sales, the average price listed for a used vehicle in July was $27,028, down from the previous month but still elevated from historical levels. Cox expects the used vehicle wholesale market to experience a slow and gradual recovery in prices to pre-pandemic levels by 2028. The global health crisis and supply chain issues caused production of new vehicles to be disrupted, leading to low supply and record-high prices. This, in turn, boosted prices in the used vehicle market.| The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index was 212.2 in August, up 0.2 from July .

Daiwa|Japanese financial services firm Daiwa has announced its intentions to expand its presence in India through an investment in Ambit. The partnership will focus on institutional equities business, equity capital market deals, and distribution of asset management products. Daiwa sees India as a partner of choice in the current global economic and political order, with plenty of opportunities in the Indian economy. Seiji Nakata, President and CEO of Daiwa Securities Group Inc, believes that India is emerging as a preferred destination for Japanese companies. With global supply chain disruptions and the China+1 strategy, Japanese companies are increasingly looking at India as a potential partner. The Indian government's initiatives, such as the production linked incentive (PLI), offer interesting opportunities in the manufacturing sector for Japanese companies. Despite the chequered track record of Japanese joint ventures in India, the sentiment towards India is changing in Japanese corporate boardrooms. With confirmed growth and a growing middle class, Japanese companies and investors are considering India as a must-invest destination. The investment in Ambit is part of Daiwa's plan to strengthen its balance sheet and fund the growth plans of its businesses.| Daiwa sees India as a partner of choice in the current global economic and political order .

Danco Laboratories|Danco Laboratories, a drug company that distributes the abortion pill mifepristone, has asked the Supreme Court to review a case challenging the legality of the medication. This comes after a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that would impose major restrictions on the use and distribution of the pill. Danco argues that the case is of great importance to women's health and the pharmaceutical industry. The Supreme Court's new term is set to begin next month. This is significant because Danco Laboratories has requested the Supreme Court to take up the case regarding the abortion pill mifepristone. If the Supreme Court agrees to hear the case and upholds the appeals court decision, it would result in more barriers for patients seeking access to the medication. The appeals court ruling on the abortion pill case is currently on hold until the Supreme Court makes a decision. The high court pressed pause on lower court decisions in April, following a request from the Biden administration. If the Supreme Court declines to take the case, the appeals court restrictions on mifepristone will go into effect.| Danco Laboratories, a drug company that distributes the abortion pill mifepristone, has asked the Supreme Court to review a case challenging the legality of the medication .

Darpa|The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) is working on a marine propulsion system called a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) drive, similar to the 'caterpillar drive' described in the movie 'The Hunt for Red October'. The MHD drive has no moving parts and works by generating a magnetic field at a right angle to an electric current, propelling the craft along silently. Engineers have been working on MHD drives for decades, and recent advancements in magnet technology may help solve some of the challenges associated with the drive. While advancements in magnet technology have made the development of a more powerful MHD drive possible, there are still challenges that need to be addressed. One challenge is protecting the electrodes from corrosion when placed in seawater and exposed to an electrical current. Coatings developed by the fuel cell and battery industries may help solve this problem. Another challenge is the resistance and reduced efficiency caused by gas bubbles created on the electrodes when a current is passed across seawater. Potential solutions include gas-diffusing electrodes and techniques to sweep away the bubbles. If the challenges associated with MHD drives can be overcome, the advantages would be significant. MHD drives would require less maintenance than existing propulsion systems due to their lack of moving parts. Additionally, they would be much quieter, which is advantageous for national defense and wildlife preservation. While commercial use of MHD drives may not be feasible in the next five years, it is a possibility for the future.| Darpa is working on a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) drive, similar to the 'caterpillar drive' described in the movie 'The Hunt for Red October' The drive has no moving parts and works by generating a magnetic field at a right angle to an electric current .
Delta|Delta Airlines has joined other carriers in reducing its profit estimates due to rising costs. The airline now expects adjusted per-share earnings of $1.85 to $2.05, down from the previous forecast of $2.20 to $2.50. Delta attributes the lower earnings to higher fuel and maintenance costs. Delta Airlines predicts a 2-3% decline in unit revenue for the third quarter compared to the previous year, which is an improvement from the earlier estimate of a potential 4% drop. This forecast reflects the industry's increased expenses and lower travel demand. Delta also maintains its full-year adjusted earnings estimate of $6 to $7 per share. American Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and Frontier Airlines have issued warnings that higher costs will impact their profits in the summer quarter. This follows similar guidance from Southwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines. The industry as a whole is facing increased expenses during a period of lower travel demand.| Delta Airlines now expects adjusted per-share earnings of $1.85 to $2.05 per share .

Delta Air Lines|Delta Air Lines is changing how customers can earn elite frequent flyer status. Starting Jan. 1, customers will earn Delta Medallion status solely based on their spending instead of a combination of dollars spent with the carrier and flights. This new model is similar to the one adopted by American Airlines. Delta is limiting access to its popular Sky Club airport lounges through certain American Express credit cards. Starting Feb. 1, 2025, American Express Platinum and Platinum Business cardholders will only get six visits a year unless they spend $75,000 on the card in a calendar year. Delta SkyMiles Reserve and Reserve Business cardholders will get 10 Sky Club visits a year, which can be increased by spending $75,000 in a year. Delta has made several changes to crack down on overcrowding at its airport lounges. Last year, the airline barred employees from using the lounges when flying standby with company travel privileges, even if they had qualifying credit cards. Delta is also raising prices for club memberships for regular customers. Delta and its competitors, such as United Airlines, are racing to build bigger and more modern lounges to accommodate customers. United Airlines recently opened a 35,000 square-foot club at its hub at Denver International Airport, the largest in its network. Tom Brady, the seven-time Super Bowl champion, has joined Delta Air Lines as a strategic advisor. In this role, Brady will work on internal employee training and participate in external advertising campaigns. He will partner with Delta to develop teamwork tools for the airline's employees and appear in select marketing campaigns. Delta Air Lines intends to leverage Tom Brady's association internally beyond being a celebrity spokesperson. The airline plans to use Brady in employee training exercises to discuss teamwork and managing adversity. Delta aims to benefit from Brady's credibility and appeal to younger consumers. The collaboration between Tom Brady and Delta Air Lines is part of a trend of celebrity employment deals in business ventures. However, such partnerships have had a mixed track record in the past. Examples include BlackBerry's hiring of Alicia Keys, Intel's hiring of will.i.am, Polaroid's hiring of Lady Gaga, and Adidas' partnership with Beyonc Knowles. Tom Brady has been increasingly involved in various business ventures. He has founded a health and wellness company called TB12 Sports, owns a media company, and has his own clothing line called the Brady Brand. Additionally, Brady is a minority owner of the British soccer team Birmingham City, a Major League Pickleball team, and a team in the E1 Series, the first electric boat racing championship. Tom Brady is expected to take on a role as a sports broadcaster after signing a deal with Fox Sports in 2022. The deal is reportedly worth $375 million over 10 years. This move further expands Brady's career beyond football and into the media industry.| Delta is limiting access to its Sky Club airport lounges through certain American Express credit cards .

Disney|On February 25, 2020, Bob Iger announced his retirement as Disney's CEO. His hand-picked successor, Bob Chapek, took over the day-to-day operations of the company immediately. However, Iger remained as executive chairman for 22 months, retaining control of creative endeavors and movie and TV content. On November 20, 2022, Bob Iger came out of retirement to become Disney's CEO once again. The board had fired Bob Chapek, and Iger subsequently fired Chapek's closest advisors. Iger extended his contract through 2026, marking the fifth time he has delayed his departure as CEO. The relationship between Bob Iger and Bob Chapek became dysfunctional, leading to corporate dysfunction and succession gone wrong at Disney. Iger had chosen Chapek as his successor based on his integrity and business acumen, but their relationship followed a similar pattern to the meltdown between Eisner and Ovitz in the 1990s. Disney has amended its federal lawsuit against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to focus solely on its First Amendment claim that the governor politically retaliated against the company. The amendment shrinks the company's federal civil complaint to 48 pages from 84 in the prior version. Disney's legal battle with Gov. Ron DeSantis began last year when the company publicly denounced the controversial classroom bill that limits classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity. DeSantis and his allies targeted the special tax district that allowed Disney to self-govern its Orlando-area theme parks, leading to Disney filing a federal lawsuit. In response to the nullification of development contracts by the DeSantis board, Disney filed counterclaims in state court, including a breach of contract claim and is seeking damages against the board. The board has asked the court to dismiss Disney's counterclaims. Disney has pulled its programming from Charter Spectrum, one of the largest cable providers in the US. This move comes as Disney-owned ESPN networks were covering major live sporting events. Charter Communications claims that Disney has insisted on a traditional long-term deal with higher rates and limited packaging flexibility, which would result in a significant cost increase for subscribers. A dispute has arisen between Disney and Charter Spectrum over carriage fees. Charter Spectrum argues that the proposal from Disney would lead to higher costs for subscribers and force them to pay for channels they may not want. Disney, on the other hand, states that it has successful deals with pay TV providers across the country and is committed to reaching a resolution with Charter. The dispute between Disney and Charter Spectrum has left sports fans without access to ESPN coverage of major sporting events. This includes the football game between the University of Florida and the University of Utah, as well as the US Open tennis matches. Fans and viewers are disappointed and hopeful for a quick resolution to the dispute.| On February 25, 2020, Bob Iger announced his retirement as Disney's CEO .

Ecoclipper|Jorne Langelaan, the owner of Ecoclipper, has restored a traditional Dutch sail barge built in 1912 and set sail on its first commercial voyage. With increasing concerns about climate change, proponents of wind-powered ships argue that sometimes old technology is the best new technology. Ecoclipper aims to build a fleet of up to 25 wind-powered cargo ships in the future. According to Gavin Allwright, secretary of the International Windship Association, wind-powered cargo shipping is making a comeback since 2012. The cost of fuel and the introduction of carbon taxes are driving the resurgence. Some historic sail cargo systems still exist, such as the Dhows of the Indian Ocean and small vessels in the South Pacific. Raybel, a 1920s Thames barge, is currently being restored in Sittingbourne, Kent. Once the restoration is complete, it will transport items like olives, coffee, and wine along the Kent coast and into London. The project aims to utilize traditional UK waterways and connect estuaries to oceans and canals.| Ecoclipper has restored a traditional Dutch sail barge built in 1912 and set sail on its first commercial voyage .

Etsy|Beyonc requested concert goers attending her Renaissance Tour to wear silver in honor of her birthday, leading to an increase in searches for silver clothing and accessories on Etsy. Small business owners, particularly those offering glittery products like disco jewelry and sparkly sunglasses, benefited from the surge in demand. Beyonc's influence on sales was evident as Etsy sellers received panicked messages and offers for expedited shipping. Beyonc's Renaissance Tour, along with Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, contributed to a boost in the economy through post-pandemic revenge spending on experiences.

Evroc|There is a concern in Europe about digital sovereignty, which refers to the region's ability to control its own data and technology. Europe heavily relies on US firms for cloud services, which has raised concerns about conflicts between EU data protection laws and US laws that grant broad access to data by intelligence and law-enforcement services. To address this, European companies like Evroc and Ionos are working towards creating European alternatives to US tech giants in the cloud computing industry. Evroc, a Stockholm-based company, aims to create Europes first sovereign hyperscale cloud, fully under the jurisdiction of European law. The company has secured C/!15m in seed funding and plans to build eight data centers in Europe over the next five years. By offering an alternative to major US cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google, Evroc aims to promote technological independence and strengthen Europe's digital sovereignty. European cloud providers, including Ionos, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, are participating in the Gaia-X project, which aims to create a federated system for cloud services. The goal is to enable data to move between different cloud service providers while ensuring data owners remain in control.

Fanbytes|Timothy Armoo, the founder of social media advertising business Fanbytes, has sold the company to a larger advertising firm called Brainlabs for an eight-figure sum. The exact amount has not been disclosed as both companies are privately held. Fanbytes connects social media influencers with big brands for promotion work and has worked with popular influencers on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Black entrepreneurs, like Timothy Armoo, face significant challenges in accessing funding for their start-ups. A recent report by Extend Ventures revealed that less than one percent of venture capital investment in the UK went to black entrepreneurs between 2009 and 2019. Additionally, black-owned businesses are four times more likely to have their loan applications rejected compared to white or South Asian business founders. Timothy Armoo's success as an entrepreneur is notable considering his upbringing on a council estate in south London and limited financial resources. He attributes some of his success to a fortunate opportunity when he won a scholarship to an independent school, which exposed him to a different world and gave him confidence.

Fidelity Investments|According to Fidelity Investments, 401(k) balances rose on average for all age groups in the second quarter compared to the same period a year earlier. The average 401(k) balance increased to $112,400, up 4% from the first quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter of growth in average balances. Fidelity's analysis revealed that the average 401(k) account balance for Baby Boomers rose by 6.3% over the past year. Those who have been saving continuously since 2008 now have an average balance of $499,000, well above the second quarter average of $220,900 for everyone in that age group. Younger workers, including Gen Xers, Millennials, and Gen Z workers, saw significant growth in their 401(k) balances over the past year. Gen Xers' balances increased by 14.5% to $153,300, Millennials' balances increased by 24.5% to $48,300, and Gen Z workers' balances increased by 66% to $8,100. Fidelity found that total contribution rates to 401(k) accounts, including employee savings and employer matches, averaged 13.9% of one's gross income in the second quarter. This rate has remained relatively stable for several quarters but is still below Fidelity's suggested savings rate of 15%. Baby Boomers had the highest average contribution rate of 16.6%. Fidelity noted that the percentage of participants with an outstanding 401(k) loan rose slightly to 17.1% in the second quarter, up from 16.6% in the first quarter.

Food and Drug Administration|The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended the expiration dates of many popular at-home Covid test products, allowing some old kits to still be safe to use. The FDA advises checking the expiration information for each test on their website before using an expired test. Using expired tests increases the chance of inaccurate results, which could put people's health at risk. Lab PCR tests, the traditional way of detecting Covid, have become more expensive and less accessible for some Americans since the end of the public health emergency in May. This change in coverage by public and private insurers may leave some people unable to get at-home tests for free through their plans. However, certain local health clinics and community sites still offer at-home tests at no cost. The FDA extends expiration dates of at-home Covid tests when manufacturers provide data showing that the tests' shelf life is longer than initially known. The initial expiration dates were sometimes short due to limited data at the time of approval. With more data gathered over time, the stability and sensitivity of these tests can be assessed over longer periods. Existing at-home tests are capable of detecting Covid infections caused by new variants, including the dominant EG.5 strain and other currently circulating variants like omicron. The FDA and experts confirm that at-home tests, as well as tests conducted at medical institutions, hospitals, and other places, recognize these new variants. The FDA also states that existing tests and medications used to treat Covid-19 remain effective against the omicron subvariant BA.2.86.| The FDA has extended the expiration dates of popular at-home Covid test products .

Ford Motor|Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley rebuffed comments by United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, stating that the company is not taking bargaining seriously ahead of a strike deadline. Farley blamed Fain for not showing up to the bargaining table and criticized the lack of genuine counteroffers from the union. Jim Farley expressed surprise that Shawn Fain, who is negotiating with General Motors and Stellantis, was absent during a meeting that he and Ford Chair Bill Ford expected Fain to attend. Farley questioned whether Fain is too busy planning strikes or PR events, which may hinder the negotiation process. The United Auto Workers (UAW) has demanded ambitious targets, including 40 hourly pay increases, a reduced 32-hour workweek, a shift back to traditional pensions, the elimination of compensation tiers, and a restoration of cost-of-living adjustments.

Foxconn|Billionaire businessman Terry Gou has resigned from the board of directors of Foxconn, the world's largest electronics manufacturer, days after announcing his bid for Taiwan's presidency. Gou founded Foxconn in 1974 and grew it into an international business empire. His resignation comes as he focuses on his political aspirations and runs as an independent presidential candidate. Foxconn's parent company, Hon Hai Technology Group, confirmed Terry Gou's resignation from the board of directors. The company stated that it would not immediately elect a new director as there are already eight other directors and independent directors on the board. Gou's resignation marks a significant change in leadership for Foxconn. After handing over leadership of Foxconn to Young Liu, Terry Gou remained as a director and joined the Kuomintang nationalist political party. Gou has declared his intention to run as an independent presidential candidate in Taiwan's upcoming election. His affiliation with the Kuomintang party adds to the already crowded China-friendly camp challenging the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party.| Billionaire businessman Terry Gou has resigned from the board of directors of Foxconn .

Frasers Group|Michael Murray, the CEO of Frasers Group, is reinventing the company by targeting new luxury aspirational customers, particularly in the Flannels shops. Despite his father-in-law, Mike Ashley, thinking the shops are 'bonkers,' Murray is showcasing his vision for aspirational shopping. This transformation has resulted in significant revenue growth for the premium lifestyle brands of Frasers Group. While Michael Murray sees Flannels as a successful venture, Mike Ashley finds it 'bonkers' and struggles to understand why people would spend so much on luxury clothing. However, Ashley acknowledges the need to be relevant to consumers and recognizes the positive results achieved by Flannels. The disagreement highlights the different perspectives between the two on the luxury retail market. Frasers Group's premium lifestyle brands, with Flannels as the main driver, have experienced significant revenue growth. However, the sports retail side of the business, including Sports Direct, still generates three times more revenue.

Gannett|Gannett, the newspaper chain, has temporarily halted the use of an AI tool called LedeAI to write high school sports dispatches after the technology produced several flawed articles. The reports written by LedeAI were criticized for being repetitive, lacking key details, and sounding like they were written by a computer with no knowledge of sports. Gannett has paused its experiment with LedeAI in all of its local markets and is evaluating vendors to ensure high journalistic standards. Several local Gannett outlets, including the Louisville Courrier Journal, AZ Central Florida Today, and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, have published similar stories written by LedeAI in recent weeks. These articles were criticized for using identical language, repeating the date of the games multiple times, and lacking originality. LedeAI CEO Jay Allred acknowledged the errors and expressed regret, but also emphasized the potential of content automation in local newsrooms. The pause in using the AI tool for sports dispatches comes after Gannett laid off 6% of its news division in December. This incident also reflects the broader challenges faced by news outlets in dealing with the rapid advancement of AI technology. Other media organizations, such as CNET, have also faced issues with AI-generated reports and some outlets have blocked access to AI software to prevent their content from being used for training AI models.| Gannett has paused its experiment with LedeAI in all of its local markets and is evaluating vendors to ensure high journalistic standards .

General Motors|General Motors (GM) has offered its largest four-year wage increase in decades as part of a new contract proposal to the United Auto Workers (UAW). The wage increase for most of GM's roughly 46,000 UAW-represented workers would be 10%, while newer employees would be eligible for up to a 56% increase over the four years. Temporary workers would also receive a 20% wage increase to roughly $20 an hour. The UAW president has called GM's wage increase offer insulting, stating that it falls far short of the union's demands. The UAW is demanding a 40% hourly pay increase, a reduced 32-hour workweek, a shift back to traditional pensions, elimination of compensation tiers, and restoration of cost-of-living adjustments, among other items. The UAW has filed unfair labor practice charges against GM and Stellantis, accusing them of not bargaining in good faith or a timely manner. Contracts for roughly 150,000 auto workers with GM, Ford Motor, and Stellantis expire after September 14. The UAW's president has stated that a strike is not the goal, but the sides remain far apart when it comes to key demands. General Motors (GM) has made a new offer to the United Auto Workers (UAW) union in an attempt to avoid a strike. The offer includes significant pay increases, more vacation days, and better benefits for retirees. However, it falls short of the union's demand for a 40% pay increase over the four years of the deal. GM released details of its new offer just hours before the UAW's strike deadline. The UAW had the option to initiate targeted strikes against GM, Ford Motor, and Stellantis if deals were not reached by 11:59 p.m. ET on Thursday. The release of the offer puts pressure on the UAW to consider the proposal. Ford has warned about the potential financial impact of meeting the UAW's demands. Sources from Ford stated that the automaker would have lost $14.4 billion over the last four years if the current demands had been in effect, instead of recording nearly $30 billion in profits. This highlights the significant financial implications of the UAW's demands for the automakers. GM President Mark Reuss announced on LinkedIn that General Motors will offer an electrified version of the Chevrolet Corvette as early as next year. While it is not clear if the all-electric version will be based on the current generation of the car or a completely different future model, Reuss hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. This move aligns with GM's plan to produce only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. There have been rumors that the current generation of the Corvette, which features a gasoline engine mounted behind the seats, could be built with a hybrid system. GM President Mark Reuss has previously hinted at the possibility of electrified variants of the car. While it remains uncertain if the hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation, the announcement of an electrified version suggests that GM is exploring different options for the Corvette's powertrain. While most all-electric vehicles in production have been four-door sedans and SUVs, various companies are now working on electric sports cars. Tesla's first car, the Roadster, was an electric sports car, and a second-generation model has been unveiled as a prototype. However, the Corvette would be one of the first iconic American sports cars to offer an electrified version, joining the growing trend of high-performance electric vehicles. Hybrid systems can be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and provide quicker acceleration. Electric motors can deliver power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines, enhancing performance. This technology has been utilized by manufacturers like Ferrari, who have developed hybrid sports cars. The potential hybrid Corvette could leverage hybrid technology to enhance its performance capabilities. General Motors has announced its plan to produce only zero-emission vehicles, including fully electric or hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles, by 2035. The decision to offer an electrified version of the Corvette aligns with this commitment and demonstrates GM's dedication to transitioning to sustainable transportation. By expanding its electric vehicle offerings, GM aims to contribute to a greener future. The Lordstown Assembly factory, a massive facility in Ohio, was closed by General Motors just months before its contract with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union expired in 2019. This closure, along with the closure of three other US plants, sparked a six-week strike at GM. The UAW won many of its bargaining goals with the strike, but Lordstown was left without new vehicles to build. Less than a month after settling with the UAW, GM sold the Lordstown plant to Lordstown Motors, an upstart EV truck maker. However, Lordstown Motors faced financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. The factory is now owned by Foxconn, which plans to make EVs for another upstart, Fisker, starting in 2025. In 2019, GM formed a joint venture with Korean manufacturer LG to build batteries for EVs. The joint venture, Ultium Cells, is crucial to GM's plans to shift to an all-EV lineup by 2035. The Ultium plant, which started building batteries last August, now has 1,100 hourly workers who are represented by the UAW. The UAW successfully negotiated a pay increase for workers at the Ultium plant, with starting wages increasing from $16.50 to $20.50 per hour. However, this is still significantly lower than the wages of veteran autoworkers at GM, Ford, and Stellantis plants. The UAW aims to include Ultium workers in GM's national labor agreement in the future. The UAW is currently in contract negotiations with GM, Ford, and Stellantis, seeking pay increases of at least 40%. The contract expires soon, and the union has threatened to go on strike if an agreement is not reached. The discussions include the shift to EVs and the union's demand for a 'just transition' for workers in the industry. General Motors CEO Mary Barra expressed frustration with the autoworker strike and stated that the company has a compelling offer for the union, including pay raises, job security, and healthcare. Barra emphasized the need for UAW leadership to return to the negotiation table to resolve the issues and get people back to work. She also pushed back against the union's demand for a fair pay increase, pointing to record levels of profit sharing for employees. The United Auto Workers (UAW) union went on strike against General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, marking the first time in history that all three of America's unionized automakers were struck simultaneously. Workers walked out of three plants in Missouri, Michigan, and Ohio. The UAW referred to this targeted strike as a Stand Up Strike, a new strategic approach to walking off the job. The UAW strike involved fewer than 13,000 of its 145,000 members, which was less extensive than initially anticipated. The strike was expected to involve all 145,000 UAW members at the three companies, potentially becoming the largest strike of active workers in 25 years. The strike was a response to the automakers' dismissal of the union's ambitious demands for increased wages, benefits, and job protections.| General Motors has offered its largest four-year wage increase in decades as part of a new contract proposal to the United Auto Workers .

Gogolook|Taiwan is a hotbed for telecoms fraud due to its small population and technical expertise in high-tech technology. Organized criminals, both Taiwanese gangs and those from mainland China and elsewhere, use Taiwan as a practice ground for new phone scams before expanding them across Asia and globally. The coronavirus pandemic and the high stock market in Taiwan have led to a surge in investment scams. Taiwanese criminal networks have opened up operations overseas, with cases of Taiwanese people being lured to countries like Cambodia under false promises of high wages and forced to work as telephone fraudsters. These criminal networks are extensive and have global reach, highlighting the need for international cooperation in combating telecoms fraud. There is a constant battle between anti-fraud firms and fraudsters, with scammers finding ways to bypass spam-blocking apps like Whoscall. Burst dialing is a common method used by fraudsters to find active phone numbers, and once a potential victim is identified, scammers employ various tactics such as offering loans or investment advice to deceive them. While AI software can help detect and intervene in scams, digital literacy and education are also crucial in preventing people from falling into traps.| Taiwan is a hotbed for telecoms fraud due to its small population and technical expertise in high-tech technology .

Goldman Sachs|Several tech companies, including chip designer Arm and Instacart, have filed to go public. Goldman Sachs CEO, David Solomon, believes that the success of these IPOs could lead to a significant increase in IPO activity in the coming months. Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms have experienced a lack of activity in IPOs and mergers over the past year. A rebound in IPOs and mergers would be welcomed by the industry. Goldman Sachs CEO, David Solomon, has faced internal dissent and criticism over his decisions and leadership style. Solomon has repeatedly stated that he does not recognize the negative portrayal of himself in the media. While IPOs are expected to rebound first, Goldman Sachs CEO believes that mergers and acquisitions will also pick up in the coming months as CEOs regain confidence. After a prolonged drought, large tech IPOs are making a comeback, which is a crucial moment for Goldman Sachs, the top advisor on Wall Street. Chip designer Arm is expected to begin trading this week, followed by delivery firm Instacart and marketing automation platform Klaviyo next week. The success of these IPOs will boost confidence in the market and help revive other parts of finance. Goldman Sachs plays a crucial role as a key advisor for the upcoming tech IPOs, including Instacart, Klaviyo, and Arm. As the lead-left advisor, Goldman's bankers drive decisions and coordinate with other banks, earning the largest portion of fees. The success or failure of these IPOs will have a significant impact on Goldman's reputation and performance. Arm's IPO, the largest listing of the year, faces challenges and doubts. There are concerns about the company's valuation, its exposure to China, and its ability to ride the artificial intelligence wave. Additionally, the small public float of Arm's stock raises questions about voting power and corporate governance. Despite high demand, some experts advise investors to avoid this IPO.| Several tech companies, including chip designer Arm and Instacart, have filed to go public .

Google|The US government has filed a landmark lawsuit against Google, accusing the company of unfairly cementing its position as the world's go-to search engine by paying billions of dollars to phone-makers and web browsers to be installed as the default option. Prosecutors argue that these deals gave Google a data advantage and blocked rivals from emerging, violating US competition laws. The trial is seen as a key test of whether the US government can rein in the tech industry. Efforts by Congress to write new rules tackling issues such as privacy and disinformation are facing challenges, and tech firms have won high-profile victories in cases challenging their responsibility for content on their platforms and their right to acquire other firms. This indicates a shift in the crackdown on tech giants that seemed imminent a few years ago. The outcome of the ongoing legal battles and trials will determine the future regulation of the tech industry. Tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are facing increasing scrutiny and legal battles. The US government's lawsuit against Google is considered a landmark case and a significant challenge to the way the tech industry operates. Other lawsuits and regulatory actions against tech giants, including Amazon and cases concerning Google's ad business and Facebook's acquisition of Instagram, are expected in the coming months. Starting in November, Google will require political advertisements to prominently disclose when they feature synthetic content, such as images generated by artificial intelligence. The rule applies to image, video, and audio content and is aimed at preventing the spread of election misinformation. The policy update comes as campaign season for the 2024 US presidential election ramps up. Digital information integrity experts have raised alarms about the use of AI-generated text, audio, and video in political advertisements. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology has made it cheap and easy to create convincing AI-generated content, which could lead to a wave of election misinformation. Social media platforms and regulators may be ill-prepared to handle this issue. AI-generated images have already been used in political advertisements. In one example, a video posted by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign used AI-generated images showing former President Donald Trump hugging Dr. Anthony Fauci. The images were designed to criticize Trump and were difficult to spot as AI-generated. The Republican National Committee also released an advertisement using AI images to imagine a dystopian United States after the reelection of President Joe Biden. Google's policy update requires disclosures on ads using synthetic content that could mislead users. Ads with synthetic content that makes it appear as if a person is saying or doing something they didn't say or do would need a label. However, the policy does not apply to synthetic or altered content that is inconsequential to the claims made in the ad, such as image resizing or color corrections. A group of top artificial intelligence companies, including Google, agreed to voluntary commitments to improve safety around their AI technologies. As part of the agreement, the companies will develop technical mechanisms, such as watermarks, to ensure users know when content was generated by AI. The Federal Election Commission is also exploring how to regulate AI in political ads. Google has reached a $93 million settlement with the state of California to resolve allegations that it was collecting consumers' data without their consent. The California Department of Justice found that Google was deceiving users by collecting, storing, and using their location data for consumer profiling and advertising purposes without informed consent. As part of the settlement, Google will have to be more transparent about its location tracking and disclose to users that their location information could be used for targeted ads. Google's location-based advertising is an important part of its business, as companies want to cater their content based on users' locations. However, the state of California alleges that Google factors in location in its behavioral profile of users and wasn't truthful about its location collection and storage tactics. The settlement requires Google to take future actions to prevent these practices, which would apply beyond California to other states. A landmark antitrust trial against Google has opened with allegations from the US Department of Justice (DOJ) that the company intentionally stifled competition and operated an illegal monopoly. The DOJ accuses Google of spending billions to maintain its dominance in the search engine market, which has harmed every computer and mobile device user in the United States. Google's opening statement in the trial highlighted its search engine as the superior product, citing Apple's decision to make Google the default search engine in its Safari browser. Google has reached an agreement in principle with multiple US states to settle an antitrust lawsuit regarding its alleged conduct in the Google Play Store. The lawsuit claimed that Google inflated prices for paid apps and in-app purchases in the Android app market. While the details of the settlement are not provided, this agreement marks another instance of Google facing scrutiny over its business practices.| Trial is seen as key test of whether the US government can rein in the tech industry .

Grindr|LGBTQ dating app Grindr ended its remote work policies and forced employees to relocate. Nearly half of its staff left. The policy gave workers two weeks to choose between relocating to their respective team's newly assigned hub city to work in-person twice a week or leave the company with severance. Approximately 80 of Grindr's 178 workers were forced to leave as of August 31. Many of these workers were hired remotely and were required to relocate to new hub cities: New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington D.C. The return-to-work policy was seen as retaliatory and in response to a union drive at the company. According to a survey of 185 US HR executives, 73% of organizations reported challenges in getting workers to return to the workplace. Seventy-one percent of employers mandating on-site work policy reported difficulty retaining workers. The tensions between employers and workers over return-to-office policies continue to persist more than three years after the Covid-19 pandemic. Some big-name employers, such as Amazon and Meta, have announced plans to get tough on enforcing their return-to-office mandates. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned employees that non-compliance with the office attendance policy could impact their future at the company. Meta informed employees that noncompliance could result in disciplinary action or dismissal.| LGBTQ dating app Grindr ended its remote work policies and forced employees to relocate .

Heathrow and Gatwick airports|Heathrow and Gatwick airports are monitoring porous concrete found on their sites after school closures linked to the material. The airports had previously found the reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) before extensive news coverage over its use. Heathrow said it had the means to keep it safe until it can put permanent solutions in place, while Gatwick said it has found no cause for concern. The discovery of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac), which can crumble in schools and public buildings, has led to a number of closures since the start of September. The material was discovered at Heathrow Terminal 3 last year, and the airport has put measures in place to make it safe. Gatwick has carried out regular inspections on the concrete and is not worried about its findings. Manchester Airport has conducted regular inspections and found no Raac concrete on site. However, the airport is running another inspection to double-check. Unions say hundreds more schools could have Raac.| The discovery of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) has led to school closures .

Hulu|Comcast and Disney are set to begin discussions on Hulu's ownership fate on September 30, months earlier than the initial January 2024 deadline. The talks will include an appraisal process, as per the original 2019 agreement, where Comcast can force Disney to buy or Disney can require Comcast to sell the remaining 33% stake in Hulu at a guaranteed minimum total equity value of $27.5 billion. Comcast CEO Brian Roberts called Hulu a great streaming business, second only to Netflix. The deal between Disney and Comcast sets up the first-ever sale of a streaming service of this magnitude. The valuation of Hulu will consider factors such as the platform's content, which is largely supplied by Disney, and the bundling of Hulu with fellow Disney services Disney+ and ESPN+ to lower churn. Synergies could be worth a couple billion dollars to a buyer of Hulu. Comcast's NBCUniversal has removed content, including series like 'Saturday Night Live,' from Hulu and put it on its own streaming platform Peacock. Disney, on the other hand, has added Hulu content to Disney+ as part of its push towards offering a one-app experience. This move aims to attract more subscribers and advertising revenue, with the one-app platform expected to be rolled out by the end of this year.| Comcast and Disney are set to begin discussions on Hulu's ownership fate on September 30, months earlier than the initial January 2024 deadline .

Hyundai|Hyundai, the second-largest carmaker in India, is committed to maintaining its diesel variants despite other carmakers abandoning diesel due to regulatory and tax pressures. Hyundai's COO, Tarun Garg, highlighted the company's success with diesel variants and the strong demand for them, especially for larger SUVs. Hyundai plans to expand its diesel portfolio with the introduction of more diesel-powered vehicles. Buyers of large SUVs prefer diesel engines due to their superior fuel efficiency, offering around 30% better mileage compared to petrol counterparts. Diesel engines also provide robust initial torque, making them effective for off-roading. These factors contribute to the enduring popularity of diesel, especially for large off-road vehicles. Despite a decrease in Hyundai's diesel share from 26% to 20% since last year, the demand for diesel vehicles remains strong in specific states. This dispels the notion of a widespread withdrawal from diesel fuel. Hyundai's commitment to diesel reflects its dedication to meeting the diverse needs of its customer base.| Hyundai plans to expand its diesel portfolio with the introduction of more diesel-powered vehicles .

IBM|IBM and Indian Bank have partnered to deploy new front-end banking applications and provide the bank with safe compute infrastructure. The collaboration aims to consolidate the bank's Front Branch Servers for better manageability and availability at both Data Centres (DC) and Disaster Recovery (DR) centers in Mumbai and Chennai. The bank plans to run its CBS workloads on the latest generation of IBM Power servers, enabling more efficient utilization of compute resources and reducing the total cost of ownership. IBM proposed a hybrid cloud approach for all AIX workloads to boost agility and meet Indian Bank's digital infrastructure needs. The approach includes a combination of Capex and Opex model for consumption of compute resources, providing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) capabilities. It aims to build a private cloud using available resources, create a single pool of processors across DC and DR, and enable services equivalent to a pay-as-you-grow model. As part of the collaboration, Indian Bank will be using IBM PowerSC for all AIX endpoints to improve security and support compliance audits for their private cloud. Additionally, the bank will utilize IBM PowerVC for simplified virtualization management, cloud deployments, workload image management, and resource optimization for IBM AIX Servers. Tech companies in England, such as Virgin Media O2 and BAE Systems, are increasingly offering apprenticeships as an alternative route for school leavers who do not want to or cannot go to university. These apprenticeships provide opportunities for individuals to learn and apply skills in real-world settings, such as cyber security and manufacturing engineering. IBM is actively recruiting individuals without degrees to create a more diverse workforce. The company recognizes that academic qualifications do not necessarily reflect a person's potential and transferable skills. By removing degree requirements from many job listings, IBM aims to provide equal opportunities for career growth and development. The tech industry is shifting its focus from academic qualifications to skills and experience. Companies like IBM are realizing that degrees are not always necessary for certain tech roles, such as software quality assurance. Instead, they are looking for individuals with relevant skills, such as teamwork, client focus, and communication, which can be acquired through alternative learning paths like bootcamps and self-guided courses.| IBM and Indian Bank have partnered to deploy new front-end banking applications and provide the bank with safe compute infrastructure .

IDBI Bank|The decision to appoint an asset valuer for IDBI Bank has caused a stir among the big four accounting firms. The qualification criteria set out in the request for proposal (RFP) document state that only valuers registered with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) are eligible for applying. The big four accounting firms, Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG, could potentially be eliminated from the selection process due to not meeting the turnover threshold or not using their IBBI-registered valuer entities for previous valuations. RBSA Valuation Advisors, a potential contender for the appointment of a valuer for IDBI Bank, was disqualified for a period of six months earlier this year due to flaws in its valuation of Videocon Industries. However, its disqualification will end on September 19, just days ahead of the deadline for submission of bids. This could make RBSA Valuation Advisors the only serious contender for the job. KPMG, one of the big four accounting firms, is conflicted in the selection process as it is already the transaction advisor for the disinvestment of IDBI Bank. This conflict of interest could potentially disqualify KPMG from being considered for the appointment of a valuer. IDBI Bank has filed an appeal with the appellate tribunal to challenge the National Company Law Tribunal's approval for the Sony-Zee merger. This move could potentially delay the big-ticket deal, which has already been approved by stock exchanges and the Competition Commission of India. The appeal has been served on behalf of IDBI Bank before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. IDBI Bank has successfully admitted its petition to initiate insolvency proceedings against Zee Entertainment Enterprise Ltd (ZEEL) over unpaid dues of Rs 150 crore. Last month, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had admitted IDBI Bank's petition. The matter is scheduled for a hearing on October 11. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has rejected IDBI Bank's objection to the composite scheme between ZEEL, Culver Max Entertainment, Sony, and Bangla Entertainment. The NCLT found that the debt is disputed, leading to the rejection of IDBI Bank's objection.

IRS|As borrowers prepare to resume paying their federal student loans, the IRS is reminding employers that they can help by offering workers up to $5,250 tax-free as part of their educational assistance benefits. This provision, which allows employers to offer tax-free subsidies to offset the payment of principal and interest on workers' federal and private student loans, is set to expire on December 31, 2025. According to the Society of Human Resource Management's employer benefits survey, only 8% of organizations offer student loan benefits to employees, while 48% offer tuition assistance. The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, but lawmakers are concerned about the lack of public awareness regarding tax-advantaged employer benefits for student loan payments. The IRS has announced a free webinar on September 14 to educate employers about the provision that allows them to offer tax-free educational assistance benefits. IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel emphasized the importance of employers not overlooking this option, as it can help attract and retain workers who are burdened by student loan debt.| Employers can offer tax-free subsidies to offset the payment of principal and interest on workers' federal and private student loans .

Illumina|Illumina's board has named Jacob Thaysen as the company's new CEO. Thaysen, a longtime executive at medical devices firm Agilent, will assume the role on September 25. This appointment comes after a proxy fight with activist investor Carl Icahn, which led to the resignation of Illumina's former CEO Francis deSouza. Following the announcement of Jacob Thaysen as the new CEO, shares of Illumina fell more than 4%. The company's market value has fallen from around $75 billion in August 2021 to roughly $25 billion. The appointment of new leadership is seen as a potential opportunity for Illumina to recover from a challenging period. Illumina is facing two orders seeking to block its acquisition of Grail. One order is from the European Commission, while the other is from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The company has appealed both orders and expects final decisions in late 2023 or early 2024. Jacob Thaysen will join Illumina as CEO while the legal battle continues. Carl Icahn, a billionaire activist investor, expressed his support for Illumina's new CEO, Jacob Thaysen. This comes as a relief for the company, which is trying to rebound from a bitter proxy fight with Icahn. Icahn, who continues to own a small stake in Illumina, launched a proxy battle over the company's decision to acquire cancer test developer Grail without approval from antitrust regulators. Illumina's former CEO, Francis deSouza, resigned after a proxy battle with Carl Icahn, despite securing enough votes to stay. Icahn was a staunch critic of deSouza and blamed him for the significant decline in Illumina's share price due to the questionable acquisition of Grail. The company's market value has fallen from around $75 billion to roughly $25 billion since closing the Grail deal. Jacob Thaysen, previously at medical devices firm Agilent Technologies, will step in as Illumina's new CEO on September 25. Thaysen has a successful track record, having doubled the operating profit of Agilent Technologies' largest analytical-lab unit. Investors will be closely watching how Thaysen approaches the Grail business and whether he can rebuild the market value that the company lost.| Jacob Thaysen named as Illumina's new CEO .

India|Former Reserve Bank of India Governor C Rangarajan lauded India's ascent to become the world's fifth-largest economy, hailing it as an impressive achievement. However, he underscored the urgent need for India to accelerate its economic growth to improve the per capita income of the nation. Post Covid-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war, there is a need to lay down a clear roadmap for India's future development, according to C Rangarajan. He emphasized that raising the growth rate is the first and foremost task, and if India achieves a seven percent rate of growth continuously over the next two decades, it can make a substantial change to the level of the economy and almost touch the status of a developed economy. C Rangarajan stressed the importance of India absorbing new technologies and skilled manpower to support its development. He acknowledged that while new technologies may lower employment elasticity with respect to output, employment must come out of increased growth. He also highlighted the need for a multidimensional development strategy, including strong export and manufacturing sectors, and emphasized that growth without equity is not sustainable. India's power ministry has directed all power plants to import 4% of their overall coal requirement for blending with domestic coal until March next year. This move is aimed at maintaining stocks amid higher consumption and to meet the country's power demand. The directive comes as India witnessed its driest August in a century, resulting in a peak power shortage of 10.7 GW. India's power and renewable energy minister, R K Singh, will chair a meeting on Monday to discuss reviving the 25 GW of gas-based power capacity that is either idled or underutilized due to lack of fuel. The meeting aims to find solutions to the challenge of meeting nighttime power supply needs, as the country has limited coal-based capacity and low generation by wind and hydro power plants. India is facing difficulties in meeting nighttime power demand due to increased consumption, hot weather conditions, anticipated rise in industrial activity, and high agricultural demand. The country's maximum power demand reached 240 GW, and the power shortage touched 10.7 GW. To address this, the power ministry has extended the mandate for utilities to import coal until March next year. India's Union Power Minister, R K Singh, announced that India may add 25 GW to 30 GW of thermal electricity generation capacity in addition to the 50 GW already under construction to meet the rising demand. He highlighted that India is growing rapidly, and the electricity demand is increasing at a fast pace. However, if the round-the-clock renewable energy works out as planned, the need for thermal power capacity addition may be avoided. R K Singh revealed that India will soon launch a pilot project to produce 100 MW of round-the-clock power using green hydrogen as storage. He stated that India aims to become the largest producer and exporter of green hydrogen and ammonia globally, leveraging its substantial manufacturing capacity for green hydrogen. Singh emphasized that green hydrogen storage is cheaper than gas and battery energy storage, making it a viable option for future growth. Singh's plans to add more thermal capacity to meet rising demand assume significance in light of India's ambitious target of having 500 GW of renewables by 2030. Currently, India has 178 GW of renewable energy capacity, including 47 GW of large hydro, 71 GW of solar, and 44 GW of wind energy. Singh also mentioned the government's initiative to provide carbon credit facilities for green hydrogen, benefiting the industry. India has increased its use of coal to generate electricity due to lower hydroelectricity output and a struggle to keep pace with record power demand. In August, power generation surged to a record 162.7 billion kilowatt hours, with coal's share in power output rising to 66.7%, the highest in six years. The government has defended the use of coal, citing lower per capita emissions compared to richer nations and rising renewable energy output. Despite higher demand for coal, power plants in India have slashed imports by 24% to 17.85 million metric tons during the first four months of the fiscal year. This is due to a 10.7% increase in production by state-run Coal India. Lower imports have kept global thermal coal prices depressed. The higher power use in India is attributed to farmers using more electricity for irrigation, intermittency of renewables, and increased cooling demand. India's peak electricity demand reached a record 243.9 gigawatts on August 31, exceeding available capacity by 7.3 gigawatts. In August, electricity supply fell short of demand by 780 million units, marking the highest shortage since April 2022. The shortage is attributed to poor monsoon, high agricultural demand, and the fall of wind generation. Weather officials expect country-wide rainfall in September to provide some respite. Coal's share in India's power output rose to 74.2% in the eight months ending in August, on track for a third consecutive annual increase. In contrast, the share of hydro power fell from 10.9% to 9.2%. Overall power generation has risen significantly, dwarfing the increase in renewable generation. India failed to achieve its target of installing 175 GW in renewable energy by 2022 and aims to boost non-fossil capacity to 500 GW by 2030. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emphasized the importance of diversity in the energy mix, stating that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner sources like solar and hydrogen. India, the world's third-largest energy consumer, believes that each nation should have the freedom to decide its energy transition pathway based on resource availability. Prime Minister Modi highlighted India's progress in renewable energy, including a 20-fold increase in solar energy capacity, ranking among the top four nations in wind energy, and leading in innovation and adoption of electric vehicles. India has achieved its climate targets nine years ahead of schedule and has set ambitious goals to reduce emissions intensity, achieve net zero by 2070, and generate 50% of electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. India has been advocating for a just, orderly, and sustainable energy transition that meets the energy needs of its growing economy. The country seeks access to technology and financing for renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and lithium-ion batteries. Prime Minister Modi believes in altering the approach to fighting climate change from a restrictive to a constructive one, focusing on empowering nations with resources and support.

In contrast, the share of hydro power fell from 10.9% to 9.2%. Overall power generation has risen significantly, with renewable generation increasing by only 16 billion units compared to over 108 billion units increase in total power generation this year. India failed to achieve its target of installing 175 GW in renewable energy by 2022. The country now aims to boost non-fossil capacity, including solar, wind, nuclear, hydro, and bio-power, to 500 GW by 2030. Achieving this target would require over 43 GW more of non-fossil capacity every year, nearly three times the average non-fossil capacity addition over the last two years. India's solar module imports from China have reduced nearly 80% by $2 billion in the first half of 2023, according to Chinese export figures collated by energy think tank Ember. The total solar module imports declined 76% to 2.3 GW between January and June 2023 from 9.8 GW in a similar period from a year ago. This reduction in imports is part of India's efforts to wean away from export dependence and build its domestic manufacturing capabilities. The Indian government has imposed a basic customs duty of 40% on solar modules, which came into effect in April last year. Additionally, the government has allocated 48.4 GW of capacity in two tranches of the production-linked incentive scheme with Rs 18,500 crore in support. These measures aim to shift India's focus from imports to building and utilizing domestic manufacturing capacity. India aims to increase its solar module manufacturing capacity to 110 GW per year by 2026, according to the report by Ember. The country plans to have an installed capacity of 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030, with 280 GW coming from solar. Despite the reduction in imports, India remains the second largest importer of solar cells from China.| Former Reserve Bank of India Governor C Rangarajan hails India's ascent to become the world's fifth-largest economy .

The bank has partnered with San Francisco-based fintech player Gusto to provide the underlying technology for the feature. The service will disburse salaries, generate tax documents and pay stubs, and file to local and national agencies. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, has invested billions of dollars in technology to compete with fintech players like PayPal and Square. The bank has previously rolled out fintech features, including a Square-like credit card reader for small businesses and early direct deposit for consumers. The partnership with Gusto for payroll services is part of JPMorgan's strategy to offer a comprehensive range of services to retain retail and business customers. JPMorgan decided to partner with Gusto for payroll services instead of building its own solution due to the complexities involved. Payroll services have nuances in individual states, cities, and counties, making it difficult to crack the sector. By using Gusto's technology, JPMorgan aims to speed up its time to market for the payroll service, which is expected to go live by the end of 2024.| JPMorgan Chase is planning to offer digital payroll processing to small business customers .

Jet Airways|Naresh Goyal, the founder of Jet Airways, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on Friday evening in an alleged money-laundering case. This arrest marks a significant downfall for Goyal, who was once a prominent figure in India's aviation industry. The arrest comes after a criminal complaint against Goyal by Canara Bank. One of the mistakes made by Naresh Goyal was the acquisition of rival airline Air Sahara in 2007. This deal caused numerous financial, legal, and human resource-related problems for Jet Airways. The acquisition reduced Jet's ability to compete effectively with other airlines and wasted IPO funds that could have been used for other purposes. Another mistake made by Naresh Goyal was the decision to buy a mixed fleet of wide-bodied Airbus A330 and Boeing 777 planes. This impractical decision increased the cost of resources and resulted in a lower seating capacity compared to the global standard. Goyal's insistence on retaining first-class seats that were not earning anything further added to the airline's financial troubles.| Naresh Goyal was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on Friday evening in an alleged money-laundering case .

Kroger|Kroger posted fiscal second-quarter sales that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. The company reported a net loss of $180 million, compared to a gain of $731 million in the year-ago period. One factor contributing to the loss was the company's settlement of the majority of claims related to the opioid crisis, resulting in a $1.4 billion charge. The slowdown in inflation has had mixed effects on retailers. While higher prices have contributed to overall sales, it has also led to a decline in the volume of merchandise sold. Kroger, which primarily sells groceries, has been less affected by the decline in discretionary merchandise. However, there is a risk that customers may turn to retailers known for lower food prices, such as Walmart, Aldi, or Dollar General. Kroger reaffirmed its full-year guidance but expects lower sales in the back half of the year. The company expects identical sales, excluding fuel, to range between 1% and 2%. However, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip stated that the company expects sales to be at the low end of the range and slightly negative in the second half of the year due to decelerating inflation and a tougher consumer backdrop. Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen mentioned that as inflation slows, the company is starting to see some volume improvement. He also noted that consumer packaged goods companies have become more willing to work with Kroger on pricing. The company has been catering to budget-minded customers with lower-priced items, personalized discounts, fuel rewards, and weekly specials. Kroger announced a deal to divest more than 400 stores and eight distribution centers to C S Wholesale Grocers as part of its effort to complete the merger with Albertsons. The approximately $1.9 billion deal will help Kroger stay on track to complete the merger early next year. The grocery merger is currently under scrutiny from antitrust officials in Washington D.C. Kroger has agreed to pay $1.2 billion to U.S. states, local governments, and Native American tribes to settle claims that it fueled the opioid epidemic through lax oversight of its pill sales. The settlement allows for the full resolution of all claims on behalf of those parties. Kroger stated that the settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or liability and that it will continue to defend against any other claims and lawsuits relating to opioids. Kroger posted a net loss for the second quarter as it took a $1.4 billion charge related to the opioid settlements and associated legal fees. The company will pay $1.2 billion to U.S. states and local governments and $36 million to Native American tribes over 11 years. The settlement is part of the ongoing efforts by state and local governments to hold drug companies and wholesalers accountable for their role in the opioid epidemic. Several retail pharmacy chains, including Walgreens, CVS, and Walmart, have announced nationwide settlement agreements related to the opioid epidemic. In November, Walgreens agreed to pay $4.95 billion, CVS agreed to pay $5 billion, and Walmart finalized a $3.1 billion settlement. These settlements aim to resolve all opioid-related claims from U.S. states, local governments, and tribes. Rite Aid, however, has not reached a nationwide settlement and is reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy.| Kroger posted fiscal second-quarter sales that fell short of Wall Street's expectations .

Lululemon|Lululemon, an athletic retailer known for its higher-end products, reported an 18% jump in revenue for the second quarter and an 11% increase in sales. The company attributes its success to new customers, as well as its ability to retain existing customers and increase their spending. Lululemon also raised its expectations for net revenue for the rest of 2023. Dollar General, a discount store, issued a lower sales and profit outlook for the year, citing weaker consumer spending and increasing theft. The company's CEO mentioned that core customers feel financially constrained, possibly due to higher costs of living and cuts in SNAP payments. Lower-income shoppers are cutting back on non-consumable and indulgent purchases to save money. The United States experienced high inflation, with the inflation rate peaking at over 9% in June 2022, the highest level in over 40 years. Although inflation has fallen since then, it remains elevated. The increase in prices has led to higher expenses for American households, with one estimate suggesting that the typical household spent $709 more in July 2022 compared to July 2021 for the same goods and services. Despite the impact of inflation, retail spending has held up surprisingly well, supported by a strong labor market. Retail analyst Brian Nagel believes that consumers are still willing to spend on innovative products from brands like Lululemon. While lower-income households may be more affected by inflation, overall consumer spending has not drastically declined.| Lululemon reported an 18% jump in revenue for the second quarter .

This collaboration allows Volkswagen to be a supplier of electric technology and parts to other automakers. Volkswagen is in talks with other players, particularly manufacturers of cars with combustion engines in Asia, about similar deals to adopt Volkswagen technology. These potential collaborations aim to produce cars for the European market. However, the details of these discussions have not been finalized. Mahindra has outlined a capital expenditure of close to Rs 10,000 crore in its EV subsidiaries between FY22 and FY27. Out of this, Rs 4,000 crore will be invested between FY22 and FY24.

Mattel|Ynon Kreiz, CEO of Mattel, aspires to create a Mattel universe similar to the success of the Marvel universe. This strategy is being implemented through the upcoming Barbie movie, which Kreiz began working on in 2018. The movie features Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken, with Greta Gerwig directing. Barbie, Mattel's biggest-selling brand, has faced criticism in the past for promoting unhealthy body image and reinforcing stereotypes. However, Mattel has learned from these issues and now focuses on diversity and inclusivity. Barbie now offers dolls with different body shapes, skin colors, and disabilities, reflecting the changing times and promoting exploration of different potentials. Mattel is restructuring its company to adapt to the changing times and move away from gender-specific products. The company aims to position itself as a talent magnet, collaborating with film directors and other creative individuals to bring new ideas to its well-known creations. Mattel recognizes that its customers are not just consumers but fans with emotional connections to their products. Mattel has unveiled the Barbie Women in Sports dolls as part of its 2023 Barbie Career of the Year-themed dolls. The dolls are dressed to represent four sports-related careers and aim to encourage girls to pursue involvement in sports.

Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes-Benz is planning to invest in infrastructure and introduce the right products in India to participate in the country's growth story. The company sold 15,822 vehicles in India in 2022, marking a 41% increase from the previous year and its highest annual sales on record. With a share of nearly 50% in the luxury vehicle segment in India, Mercedes-Benz is on track to report record sales for the second consecutive year in 2023. While high-tech internal combustion vehicles are currently the mainstay for Mercedes-Benz in India, the company believes that the future will be electric. Mercedes-Benz India already sells four electric car models in the local market. The company is also investing in Mercedes-Benz charging infrastructure in India to offer charging stations to its customers. Mercedes-Benz plans to introduce four all-electric vehicles on the Mercedes Modular Architecture globally. The first of these, the Concept CLA, will go into commercial production in 2025 and will be simultaneously launched in India. The luxury carmaker has its largest R&D set-up outside of Germany in Bengaluru, where a team of over 5,000 engineers is working on global development projects. Ola Kallenius, chairman of the board of management at Mercedes-Benz AG, highlights the need for more structured immigration policies in the West to encourage young talent from elsewhere to settle. Kallenius believes that all regions need to think about human capital and that intelligent and structured immigration is necessary to address labor shortages. He also cautions against implementing restrictions on labor laws and flexibility, as it may hinder competitiveness with countries like India and China. Luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz has unveiled its revamped showroom MAR 20X in Madurai, India. The MAR 20X format is based on the four pillars of Design Architecture Customer-oriented process and Digital enhancements. The showroom, spread across 30,000 sq ft, will display all cars from the Mercedes-Benz stable and is served by 35 trained staff. With the inauguration of the MAR 20X 3S facility in Madurai, the total number of Mercedes-Benz outlets operated by the automaker in India has risen to 12. The MAR 20X showroom, located on the Kappalur by-pass, will serve customers from Madurai and neighboring districts. The MAR 20X showroom in Madurai is an integrated 3S facility, offering Mercedes-Benz certified and private and semi-private consultancy areas for customers. The facility was inaugurated by Mercedes-Benz Vice-President Customer Services and Corporate Affairs Shekhar Bhide in the presence of Sundaram Motors Executive Director Sharath Vijayaraghavan and senior officials. Mercedes-Benz has unveiled new concept vehicles at the IAA Mobility auto show in Munich. The Concept CLA Class comprises four new models, including a sedan, a station wagon, and two SUVs. These vehicles are expected to have a range of more than 466 miles on a single charge, surpassing any Tesla model. BMW has revealed a new electric vehicle, the Vision Neue Klasse, at the IAA Mobility auto show. The vehicle, still in the concept stage, uses newly developed battery cells that can store over 20% more energy than previous models. BMW expects the charging speed and range of the Vision Neue Klasse to be improved by up to 30% compared to its previous models. Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Kllenius announced that the Concept CLA Class represents an entirely new all-electric segment of entry-level vehicles. The longer range of these vehicles, exceeding 466 miles on a single charge, may help Mercedes-Benz attract more customers, as range anxiety is often a major consideration for EV buyers.

Microsoft|Microsoft announced that business customers in Europe will be able to purchase its video and chat app, Teams, separately from its Office software. This change will take effect from October 1 and will impact business customers in the EU and four other European countries. The move comes after the European Union opened an antitrust investigation into Microsoft's bundling of products. In addition to allowing the separate purchase of Teams, Microsoft will also make it easier for other companies, such as Zoom and Slack, to integrate their products with Microsoft 365. This move aims to provide European business customers with access to a wider range of solutions at competitive prices. Microsoft will continue to engage with the antitrust investigation and explore solutions that benefit both customers and developers in Europe. Microsoft will charge big business customers $2.2 less per month for Microsoft 365 and Office 365 subscriptions that do not include the Teams app. This change allows enterprise customers to choose whether to include Teams in their productivity suite or opt for a suite without Teams. New enterprise customers can also purchase Teams separately for $5.4 per month.| Microsoft announced that business customers in Europe will be able to purchase its Teams app, Teams, separately from its Office software .

Moderna|Moderna announced that clinical trial data showed its updated COVID-19 vaccine is likely effective against the highly-mutated BA.2.86 subvariant of the coronavirus. The vaccine generated an 8.7-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies against BA.2.86, which is being tracked by the WHO and CDC. This finding has been shared with regulators and is expected to be available later this month or in early October. Moderna's head of infectious diseases, Jacqueline Miller, stated that the positive vaccine data should reassure regulators and encourage people to get their fall boosters. The CDC has previously indicated that BA.2.86 may be more capable of causing infection in previously infected or vaccinated individuals. Moderna's retooled vaccine has been submitted for peer review publication and is awaiting approval from the FDA. Moderna, Pfizer with BioNTech, and Novavax have created versions of their COVID-19 vaccines aimed at the XBB.1.5 subvariant, which was the dominant variant through most of 2023.

NFL|According to a survey by the American Gaming Association, a record 73.5 million Americans plan to bet on the NFL this season, up from 46 million last year. The survey found that 19% of American adults plan to place a bet online or with a bookie, a 56% increase from the previous year. Self-identified NFL fans are expected to place more bets than ever, with a 42% increase from last year. The Supreme Court's decision in 2018 paved the way for states to legalize sports betting, and currently, it is legal in 34 states and Washington D.C. The growth of legal gambling and the ability to place wagers on phones has attracted a flood of users to major players like DraftKings, FanDuel, Caesars, and BetMGM. The NFL has embraced this change and signed five-year deals worth an estimated $1 billion combined with DraftKings, FanDuel, and Caesars to become the league's official sportsbook partners. Sportsbooks are now being integrated into stadiums, with the Washington Commanders, Arizona Cardinals, New York Giants, and Jets having physical sportsbooks either within or outside their venues. NFL owners have also voted to allow sportsbooks to operate on game days in states where sports betting is legal. The NFL has struck deals with companies like Aristocrat to allow NFL-branded slot machines in casinos and has partnered with FanDuel to offer fans $100 off the NFL's Sunday Ticket for placing a small wager. As the NFL adapts to the new normal for gambling, it has experienced growing pains. Player confusion over the league's betting rules has led to multiple suspensions, with at least 10 players being suspended for violating the NFL's gambling policy in the past two years. The league is working to address these issues and ensure clarity for players. According to BetMGM, the Kansas City Chiefs are the favorites to win the Super Bowl, and bettors are backing them to cover the point spread in the Week 1 opener.

Nane Solutions|Stanford Mogotsi, the co-owner of Johannesburg-based software company Nane Solutions, remains committed to South Africa despite the challenges of running a small IT firm in the country. The shift from consulting to software development and the impact of South Africa's tough coronavirus lockdowns resulted in most of the company's founders leaving. The economic backdrop in South Africa is uncertain, making it difficult for small firms to compete with multinational IT companies. The IT sector in South Africa is facing a brain drain as many talented IT professionals are finding jobs overseas. The country's IT companies, like Nane Solutions, struggle to fill positions due to the salary gap compared to large firms overseas. The opportunities for IT professionals to move abroad are more easily available, resulting in a shortage of skilled workers in the sector. Despite the brain drain, South Africa still has successful software start-ups that are producing popular products. One example is the app EskomSePush, which warns users across South Africa about power cuts. The app, launched in 2015, has gained significant popularity with over 7 million devices and a million people clicking on notifications. It is monetized through advertising revenues. Computer science lecturers at the University of Johannesburg have developed a cricket video software system that aims to help produce the next generation of South African batsmen and women.

Narrowboat dwellers|Narrowboat dwellers in London, such as Amy Cross and Wes Arthur, are known for their energy-conscious lifestyle. They rely on solar panels for electricity, strategically plan their energy usage, and make sacrifices when it comes to energy-gobbling devices. They have also invested in more efficient inverters and lithium batteries for better energy storage. Narrowboaters face challenges in managing their energy usage, especially during winter. They have to strategize which electrical devices to use simultaneously to avoid overloading the system. Some boaters go without refrigerators or cool boxes, and certain devices like hairdryers and irons are nearly impossible to run. The cost of solar installation remains high, although the technology has improved. Environmental restrictions, such as eco-mooring zones and smoke control areas, have caused controversy among narrowboaters in London. Some argue that narrowboat living is already environmentally conscious, while others highlight the financial and space limitations of upgrading energy systems. There is a need for financial support and increased connections to mains electricity to help narrowboaters meet the requirements.| Narrowboat dwellers in London are known for their energy-conscious lifestyle .

Netflix|Netflix is slowly ramping up plans to offer more gaming experiences to subscribers, considering games as a key part of its proposition to stay relevant with audiences. Currently, mobile games tied to famous Netflix franchises like Stranger Things are available to play, with tests underway to explore their compatibility with TVs and computers. Netflix's low-key approach and focus on mobile games first is seen as a clever strategy to understand the gaming landscape and cater to gamers' preferences. Ripstone Studios, known for making chess games, became one of the first companies to partner with Netflix to develop a game based on the popular television series The Queen's Gambit. The collaboration is seen as a collaborative partnership rather than just a licensing agreement, with both companies sharing expertise. The aim is to design a game that is accessible to as many people as possible, even those who have never played a video game before, in order to broaden the popularity of gaming as a form of entertainment. Netflix's approach to game development is different from what has been seen before, focusing on mobile titles that are cheaper to make and have less financial risk compared to big console releases. However, the success of this approach will depend on impressing players and capturing their attention in a highly competitive gaming space. Netflix aims to ensure that it is doing things in the right way and is still in the early stages of its games journey.| Netflix is slowly ramping up plans to offer more gaming experiences to subscribers .

ONGC|Finding offshore rigs has become harder and more expensive for ONGC as the market for oilfield services has become very tight. ONGC sought 12 rigs for its projects but only received 10, and the new rig contracts were about 50% more expensive than previous deals. ONGC is now in the market for eight jackup rigs and has increased the mobilization fee and introduced favorable terms to attract rig suppliers. The market for oilfield services, including offshore rigs, is extremely tight globally. The utilization rate for offshore rigs has gone above 90%, compared to the normal rate of around 80%. This tight market extends to other oilfield services as well as crew, making it challenging for companies like ONGC to find the necessary resources. ONGC is aggressively holding roadshows and reaching out to potential service providers to attract rig suppliers. They are highlighting the benefits of doing business with a government-run company that honors contracts and works on a short payment window. ONGC has also increased the mobilization fee and introduced favorable terms to make the partnership more rewarding for rig suppliers. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will invest about Rs 15,000 crore in ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPaL) as part of a financial restructuring exercise. This move will see gas utility GAIL being edged out of the petrochemical firm. ONGC will convert share warrants into equity buy-back debentures and invest Rs 7,000 crore more equity, giving it about 95% stake in OPaL. The ONGC board has approved a financial restructuring of OPaL, which has been making losses due to its high debt. ONGC will buy-back compulsory convertible debentures (CCDs) of Rs 7,778 crore issued by OPaL, and also invest Rs 7,000 crore in equity/quasi-equity security of OPaL. Upon implementation, OPaL will become a subsidiary of ONGC, leading to increased profitability. GAIL India Ltd and Gujarat State Petrochemical Corp (GSPC) will together hold close to 5% stake in OPaL post-financial restructuring. GAIL had initially picked up a stake in OPaL in 2008, but due to major cost and time overruns, it decided to restrict its equity contribution. The completion of the mega petrochemical complex at Dahej cost about Rs 30,000 crore, leading to accumulated losses of Rs 13,000.3 crore for OPaL.| ONGC sought 12 rigs for its projects but only received 10, and the new rig contracts were about 50% more expensive than previous deals .

Origin by Ocean (ObO)|Excessive outbreaks of seaweed and microalgae in waters from the Caribbean to the Baltic are being harvested alongside farmed crops to create ingredients for cosmetics and food products. The microalgae extracts can be used in detergents, animal feed, packaging, and even as a replacement for plastic. This trend aligns with the growing demand for seaweed as a sustainable alternative to oil-based ingredients. Dr. Mari Granstrm, a Finnish biochemist, founded Origin by Ocean (ObO) to address the problem of toxic microalgae blooms in the Baltic Sea. ObO collects microalgae off the coast of Finland and imports invasive sargassum seaweed from the Caribbean. The company uses patented biorefinery technology to separate the algae into various usable materials, which are then sold to food, cosmetics, textiles, packaging, and agricultural companies. Nordic Seafarm, a commercial spin-off from the Swedish government-funded project Seafarm, is showcasing the versatility of seaweed.

Philips Respironics|Philips Respironics, the maker of CPAP sleep apnea machines, has agreed to pay at least $479 million in a settlement over alleged health risks from toxic sound-reducing foam. The settlement will compensate users who bought or rented the recalled devices and those who incurred out-of-pocket costs. Philips Respironics did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the agreement. In 2021, Philips recalled about 10.8 million devices used to reduce sound and vibration in CPAP machines. The silicone-based foam used in these devices was found to break down and potentially be inhaled by users. While there have been reports of health issues such as headaches and sinus infections, Philips stated that the potential health risks could range from transient injuries to serious, life-threatening complications. The FDA has received reports alleging at least 385 deaths associated with the breakdown of the foam used in Philips Respironics devices since April 2021. Forty of these reports occurred in the first three months of 2023. Philips Respironics maintains that potential exposure to foam particles or emissions is unlikely to result in significant harm to health. As part of the settlement, Philips will pay awards to users for each recalled device, ranging from $55.63 to $1,552.25. Users will also receive a device return award of $100 for each recalled device returned to the company. Philips has set aside 575 million euros (approximately $615 million) in the first quarter of 2023 to cover the estimated costs. Personal injury and medical monitoring claims are not included in the settlement and will be pursued separately.| Philips Respironics agreed to pay at least $479 million in a settlement over alleged health risks from toxic sound-reducing foam .

Reliance Industries|Reliance Industries, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, is considering entering the semiconductor manufacturing industry to address its supply chain needs and meet the growing chip demand in India. The conglomerate has held early-stage talks with foreign chipmakers to potentially become technology partners. Reliance sees merit in this move as it would help safeguard against chip shortages that could impact its telecom and electronic devices businesses. Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goal of making India a chipmaker for the world, the country's chip ambitions have faced setbacks. India currently does not have any chip manufacturing plants, although companies like Vedanta and Foxconn are considering building facilities. The collapse of a $19.5 billion venture between Vedanta and Foxconn and the slow progress of ISMC's $3 billion investment plans have hindered India's chip ambitions. With a market capitalization of around $200 billion, Reliance Industries is considered one of the best-positioned companies in India to venture into semiconductors. The conglomerate has deep pockets and expertise in working with the government. However, entering the chip manufacturing industry requires finding a tech partner, which is crucial for Reliance's success. Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries has partnered with chipmaker Nvidia to develop India's own large language model trained on the country's diverse languages. Nvidia will provide access to its GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip and DGX Cloud to build AI infrastructure. This collaboration aims to create technology infrastructure for widespread growth and bring AI to all households in India. Mukesh Ambani announced at the company's AGM that Reliance Industries will be developing India-specific AI models and AI-powered solutions. The partnership with Nvidia will help Reliance build AI applications and services. The AI infrastructure provided by Nvidia will be hosted in AI-ready computing data centers, eventually expanding to 2,000 MW. Reliance Industries is reportedly exploring a foray into semiconductor manufacturing to address its supply chain needs and cater to growing chip demand in India. The conglomerate has held early-stage talks with foreign chipmakers to become technology partners. With advanced AI computing infrastructure, Reliance aims to build its own large language models for generative AI applications made in India. The Delhi High Court's division bench has asked for a response from Reliance Industries and other parties regarding the government's appeal accusing them of committing fraud and unjust enrichment of over $1.729 billion by siphoning gas from deposits they had no right to exploit. The government argues that RIL knew about the connectivity of its block with the adjoining ONGC block and deliberately extracted and sold the ONGC gas without the government's knowledge. Reliance Industries, through its counsel Sameer Parekh, has opposed the government's appeal, stating that the issues cannot be reopened under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. The lawyer argued that the migration of gas could have been studied by the ministry in 2009 itself, but they chose not to do so. RIL also claimed that it would have been infeasible to extract gas from the underdeveloped ONGC block at that time. The government is seeking to set aside the international arbitration award that ruled in favor of the RIL-led consortium. They argue that the award strikes at the heart of public policy and has given a premium to RIL, which they accuse of committing fraud and criminal offenses. The government raised a demand of $1.47 billion in 2014 for disgorgement of unjust enrichment made by draining and selling gas from adjacent ONGC blocks.| Reliance Industries, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, is considering entering the semiconductor manufacturing industry .

Reliance Jio|Reliance Jio has requested the telecom regulator, Trai, for flexible use of spectrum between satellite and terrestrial networks, specifically in the Ku and Ka bands. Jio highlighted the recent decision by the New Zealand government to allow dual use of spectrum. The suggestion for flexible use is based on the latest changes in technology and standards that enable the creation of integrated and converged networks. The New Zealand government has agreed to allocate the 24.25-27.5 GHz band primarily for mobile use, with the option to include some satellite services in certain areas. The 27.5-28.35 GHz range will be shared for mobile and satellite services, while the 28.35-29.5 GHz band will be allocated for satellite services, with the option to include some mobile use. This decision demonstrates the recognition of the need for flexible use of spectrum in the wake of technological convergence in telecommunication networks. Jio highlights that the 3GPP specifications in release-17 have enabled the convergence of satellite and terrestrial networks. Several countries have been considering the assignment of spectrum for flexible use between these networks. Jio urges the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to ensure the optimum and evolving technology-centric assignment of spectrum, as it is a finite and scarce resource for wireless broadband connectivity. Satcom firms like OneWeb and Amazon, backed by the Bharti Group, are advocating for administrative allocation of spectrum. On the other hand, telecom operators Jio and Vodafone Idea are in favor of spectrum allocation to the highest bidder, similar to the case of telcos. This highlights the ongoing debate regarding the allocation of spectrum for satellite communication services. Reliance Jio has shared with Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) a recent decision taken by the New Zealand government, allowing the use of 24-30 GHz spectrum in the Ka band for satellite and mobile services. Jio emphasizes that the suggestion for flexible use of spectrum is based on the latest changes in technology and standards, enabling the creation of integrated and converged networks. The New Zealand government has agreed to allocate the 24.25-27.5 GHz range primarily for mobile use, with the option to include some satellite services in certain areas. The 27.5-28.35 GHz range will be shared for mobile and satellite services, while the 28.35-29.5 GHz range will be allocated for satellite services, with the option to include some mobile use. Jio has requested that the reserved quantum for satellite services in the Ka and Ku bands should have flexible use. They argue that the 3GPP specifications in release-17 have enabled the convergence of satellite and terrestrial networks, and technological advancements support the integration of networks in the future. Satcom firms like OneWeb and Amazon are advocating for administrative allocation of spectrum, while telcos like Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea want satcom spectrum to be allotted through auctions. Jio and Vodafone Idea argue for the same service, same rules principle and cite a 2012 Supreme Court order on the allocation of natural resources to demand an auction. Reliance Jio has applied to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) seeking approval to widen the use of E-band spectrum for access or mobility use, in addition to backhaul. Jio argues that with technological advancements, the distinction between the two has vanished. The move comes ahead of an expected consultation paper by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on the mode of allocating such airwaves. Jio has requested the DoT to send a fresh reference to Trai, stating that E-band spectrum can also be used for mobile services. Jio believes that the use of integrated access backhaul (IAB) E-band spectrum can provide high-speed broadband in densely populated areas where laying fiber is difficult and uneconomical. While Jio has not explicitly asked for auctioning E-band spectrum, it has requested the DoT to clarify that E-band spectrum can be used for mobile services. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has changed its stance on the allocation mechanism for spectrum after a 2012 Supreme Court order backed auction as the mode of allocation for scarce natural resources like airwaves. DoT was considering auction as a mode to allocate E and V bands as well as backhaul carriers, a move opposed by technology companies. Trai is expected to come out with a consultation paper on the mechanism for allocating E and V bands spectrum and backhaul carriers to telecom operators.| Reliance Jio has requested the telecom regulator Trai for flexible use of spectrum between satellite and terrestrial networks, specifically in the Ku and Ka bands .

Tesla|Tesla has combined a series of innovations, including the use of huge presses and die casting techniques, to make a technological breakthrough in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing. This breakthrough has allowed Tesla to slash production costs and develop cars from the ground up in a much shorter time frame compared to its rivals. The company's unboxed manufacturing strategy aims to produce large sub-assemblies of a car and snap them together, potentially disrupting the industry. Tesla's breakthrough in gigacasting, which involves casting large structures for EVs, centers around the design and testing of giant molds using 3D printing and industrial sand. These innovations have enabled Tesla to incorporate hollow subframes with internal ribs, reducing weight and improving crashworthiness. The use of sand casting with 3D printing allows for cost-effective design validation and rapid prototyping, significantly reducing the time and cost involved in the traditional metal mold process. One major hurdle Tesla had to overcome in gigacasting was the behavior of aluminum alloys in sand molds, which often failed to meet the company's crashworthiness criteria. However, casting specialists were able to formulate special alloys, fine-tune the cooling process, and implement after-production heat treatment to address this issue. Once Tesla is satisfied with the prototype mold, it can invest in a final metal mold for mass production. Tesla is considering casting the underbody of its upcoming small EV in one piece, which would simplify the manufacturing process. However, the choice of gigapress and the complexity of the car frame would need to be determined. Tesla would require new, larger gigapresses with high clamping power to punch out such large body parts quickly, but these presses may not be able to accommodate the 3D printed sand cores needed for hollow subframes. Alternatively, Tesla could use a different type of press that allows for slow alloy injection, which produces higher quality castings but takes longer.| Tesla has combined a series of innovations to make a technological breakthrough in electric vehicle manufacturing .

Twitter|Twitter, now known as X, announced that it may collect biometric and employment information from its users, expanding the range of personal information exposed on the platform. The new privacy policy allows X to collect and use biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes. Additionally, X may collect users' employment and educational history to suggest potential job openings, share with prospective employers, or target users with advertising. X will offer X Premium users the option to provide a government ID and a selfie image for verification purposes. The company will extract biometric data from both the government ID and the selfie image to match the user's identity. This verification process aims to fight impersonation attempts and enhance platform security. Twitter's policy adjustment aligns with what many of its peers already collect, but it represents an expansion of the types of information Twitter is interested in tracking. The change comes as owner Elon Musk aims to transform the platform into an 'everything app' with features like financial services. It also coincides with regulatory initiatives worldwide that require social media companies to verify users' ages. A federal judge temporarily blocked an Arkansas law mandating age verification for social media platforms just hours before it was due to take effect. The law required users to upload copies of their government-issued identification or selfies for analysis by artificial intelligence. The temporary block raises questions about the implementation of age-assurance services and their impact on social media platforms. Elon Musk, the owner of X (formerly known as Twitter), has threatened to sue the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for defamation. Musk claims that the ADL's statements about rising hate speech on the platform have negatively impacted X's advertising revenue. Musk also accuses the ADL of falsely accusing him of being anti-Semitic. The ADL recently met with X's leadership, including CEO Linda Yaccarino, to discuss ways to revive ad revenue. Yaccarino thanked ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt for the meeting and expressed the intention to build a strong and productive partnership based on good intentions and candor. Under Elon Musk's ownership, the volume of hate speech on X has grown dramatically. Watchdog organizations, such as the ADL and the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), have reported an increase in antisemitic content and a decrease in the moderation of such posts. Musk, however, claims that hate speech impressions continue to decline since he took over the platform. Elon Musk has sued the CCDH, accusing the nonprofit group of deliberately trying to drive advertisers away from X. Musk claims that the CCDH violated the platform's terms of service and federal hacking laws. The CCDH's CEO, Imran Ahmed, dismisses the lawsuit as a conspiracy theory and suggests that Musk is trying to shift blame for his own failings as a CEO. Twitter's parent company, X Corp., has filed a lawsuit against California's attorney general over the state's new content moderation law. The law requires social media companies to disclose their terms of service and submit reports on their content moderation policies. X Corp. alleges that the law violates the First Amendment and could compel the company to moderate politically charged speech. Under Elon Musk's leadership, Twitter has faced a major revenue hit and made changes to its content policies. Musk has expressed his views on speech permitted on the platform, leading to concerns about the approach to content moderation. The platform has ceased enforcement of its Covid-19 misinformation policy and reinstated previously banned users. X Corp., led by Elon Musk, has threatened to sue the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for defamation. Musk claims that the ADL's statements about rising hate speech on the platform have affected the company's advertising revenue. The ADL has not commented on the legal threat, but its CEO has spoken out against the BanTheADL campaign on Twitter. In its lawsuit, X Corp. alleges that California's content moderation law could pressure social media platforms to limit or censor constitutionally-protected content. The company claims that the law could force platforms to take public positions on controversial issues to avoid public scrutiny. The lawsuit seeks a jury trial to determine the constitutionality and legal validity of the law.| Twitter, now known as X, announces that it may collect biometric and employment information from its users .

Viacom18|Viacom18 aims to build a profitable sports business with committed investments of over C/134,000 crore for properties like Indian Premier League (IPL) digital rights, India bilateral cricket matches, Women's Premier League, Indian Super League, and 2024 Summer Olympics. The company recently won the TV and digital rights to all domestic and international cricket matches held in India for C/15,963 crore till 2028. Viacom18's CEO, Anil Jayaraj, stated that the company's fundamental perspective remains unchanged, with digital on the rise and television experiencing a decline. The company wants to use the power of cricket to enable the transition of consumers from linear TV to digital, including connected TV (CTV). Viacom18 believes that the monetization of sports content will be driven by mobile and CTV. Viacom18's strategy for India cricket is to serve mobile and CTV consumers on digital platforms and pay and free-to-air audiences on linear TV. The upcoming India vs. Australia series will be aired on Sports18 channel, as well as Hindi and regional entertainment and movie channels. The company's streaming platform, JioCinema, will continue to provide high-quality coverage with multi-lingual presentation and features like multi-camera and 4K. Viacom18's CEO, Anil Jayaraj, is particularly bullish about CTV, which currently has a reach of 40 million homes and is expected to grow dramatically in the coming years. The company believes that the CTV base in India is 40 million and sees potential in non-cricket properties like the Olympics, football, basketball, badminton, and motorsports. Jayaraj is confident that monetization will catch up as viewership numbers for niche sports increase. Viacom18, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, has secured exclusive media rights for international and domestic matches by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for a cumulative figure of Rs 5,963 crore for the next five years between September 2023-March 2028. The media rights tender by the governing body was floated for five years, covering 88 matches. Viacom18 will have rights for tournaments such as International Men's and Women's matches and domestic first-class competitions. The shift towards digital sports consumption in India has been significant, and winning the global digital rights for BCCI matches will further fuel this trend. Viacom18 Sports CEO Anil Jayaraj stated that winning the broadcast rights is an extension of their strategy to serve quality and affordable content to viewers as they continue to migrate from linear TV to digital screens. With the acquisition of media rights for BCCI matches, Viacom18 will expand its current media rights portfolio, which already includes tournaments like TATA IPL, TATA WPL, Olympics 2024, SA20, Major League Cricket (MLC), Ultimate Table Tennis (UTT), NBA, Diamond League World Athletics Championships Budapest 2023, MotoGP, LALIGA, Ligue1, Serie A, BGIS E-Sports, Abu Dhabi T10, FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, and top BWF events.| Viacom18 aims to build a profitable sports business with committed investments of over C/134,000 crore .

Volocopter|Volocopter, an aviation start-up, plans to launch its two-seater electric aircraft, VoloCity, in Paris in time for the Summer Olympics. This will be the first service in Europe to use an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft. Volocopter expects to receive clearance from the European aerospace regulator to carry passengers in the next few months and aims to offer three routes connecting the center of Paris with the city's airports and heliport. German-based Lilium has developed a larger EVTOL aircraft designed to carry up to six passengers. Unlike Volocopter, Lilium uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted for vertical lift and forward flight. Lilium expects to receive certification from the European aerospace regulator in 2025 and sees potential in offering connections around congested cities or areas with poor rail links.
