The high price arbitrage may lead to more sales through grey markets and consumers purchasing units when they travel abroad. Increasing currency arbitrage between the dollar and the rupee and the customs duty of 22% on the Pro models, which are not made in India, are the leading causes for the steep price hikes in India.

Social media is filled with posts on how consumers buying iPhone 15 Pro series models in Dubai can recover the cost of travel with the savings. Apple has introduced more differentiation in the Pro models with industry-first features like the 3nm Apple A17 chip, titanium frame, faster data transfer speeds, and improved cameras.

The iPhone 15 Pro Max 1 terabyte is priced at Rs 1,99,900 in India, marking a 51% increase when compared to the US price of $1,599. The base variant of the iPhone 15 Pro is priced at Rs 1,34,900 in India compared to Rs 82,917 in the US. Several factors contribute to the price disparities of iPhones in India. One reason is the supply chain, as several components are shipped after the payment of import duty. Additionally, the scale of business in India is much less compared to the US and Dubai. Apple collaborates with partners to offer discounts and trade-in options to mitigate the impact of customs duties and taxes on the final pricing of imported models. Apple's initial focus in India remains on the previous-generation models, allowing consumers to warm up to the new ones gradually. Older generation iPhones are propelling Apple's growth in India. The company plans to invest in marketing, supply chain, and affordability offers for previous-gen iPhone models, which contribute to the majority of volumes in India.|'Made in India Apple iPhone 15 to cost more in India than US Dubai|Y|Sep 14, 2023, 05:19 PM |The prices of iPhone 15 in India are significantly higher compared to the US and Dubai, even though some of these iPhones are manufactured within the country.

The government argues that RIL knew about the connectivity of its block with the adjoining ONGC block and deliberately extracted and sold the ONGC gas without the government's knowledge. Reliance Industries, through its counsel Sameer Parekh, has opposed the government's appeal, stating that the issues cannot be reopened under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.

RIL also claimed that it would have been infeasible to extract gas from the underdeveloped ONGC block at that time.

In August, power generation surged to a record 162.7 billion kilowatt hours, with coal's share in power output rising to 66.7%, the highest in six years. The government has defended the use of coal, citing lower per capita emissions compared to richer nations and rising renewable energy output. Despite higher demand for coal, power plants in India have slashed imports by 24% to 17.85 million metric tons during the first four months of the fiscal year. This is due to a 10.7% increase in production by state-run Coal India. Lower imports have kept global thermal coal prices depressed. The higher power use in India is attributed to farmers using more electricity for irrigation, intermittency of renewables, and increased cooling demand. India's peak electricity demand reached a record 243.9 gigawatts on August 31, exceeding available capacity by 7.3 gigawatts. In August, electricity supply fell short of demand by 780 million units, marking the highest shortage since April 2022. The shortage is attributed to poor monsoon, high agricultural demand, and the fall of wind generation. Weather officials expect country-wide rainfall in September to provide some respite. Coal's share in India's power output rose to 74.2% in the eight months ending in August, on track for a third consecutive annual increase. In contrast, the share of hydro power fell from 10.9% to 9.2%. Overall power generation has risen significantly, dwarfing the increase in renewable generation.

This breakthrough has allowed Tesla to slash production costs and develop cars from the ground up in a much shorter time frame compared to its rivals. The company's unboxed manufacturing strategy aims to produce large sub-assemblies of a car and snap them together, potentially disrupting the industry. Tesla's breakthrough in gigacasting, which involves casting large structures for EVs, centers around the design and testing of giant molds using 3D printing and industrial sand. These innovations have enabled Tesla to incorporate hollow subframes with internal ribs, reducing weight and improving crashworthiness. The use of sand casting with 3D printing allows for cost-effective design validation and rapid prototyping, significantly reducing the time and cost involved in the traditional metal mold process. One major hurdle Tesla had to overcome in gigacasting was the behavior of aluminum alloys in sand molds, which often failed to meet the company's crashworthiness criteria. However, casting specialists were able to formulate special alloys, fine-tune the cooling process, and implement after-production heat treatment to address this issue. Once Tesla is satisfied with the prototype mold, it can invest in a final metal mold for mass production. Tesla is considering casting the underbody of its upcoming small EV in one piece, which would simplify the manufacturing process. However, the choice of gigapress and the complexity of the car frame would need to be determined. Tesla would require new, larger gigapresses with high clamping power to punch out such large body parts quickly, but these presses may not be able to accommodate the 3D printed sand cores needed for hollow subframes. Alternatively, Tesla could use a different type of press that allows for slow alloy injection, which produces higher quality castings but takes longer.|Gigacasting 2.0 Tesla reinvents carmaking with quiet eakthrough|Y|Sep 14, 2023, 03:37 PM |Tesla has made a breakthrough in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing by using innovative techniques such as gigacasting and 3D printing.

In August, power generation surged to a record 162.7 billion kilowatt hours, with coal's share in power output rising to 66.7%, the highest in six years. The government has defended the use of coal, citing lower per capita emissions compared to richer nations and rising renewable energy output. Despite higher demand for coal, power plants in India have slashed imports by 24% to 17.85 million metric tons during the first four months of the fiscal year. This is due to a 10.7% increase in production by state-run Coal India. Lower imports have kept global thermal coal prices depressed. The higher power use in India is attributed to farmers using more electricity for irrigation, intermittency of renewables, and increased cooling demand. India's peak electricity demand reached a record 243.9 gigawatts on August 31, exceeding available capacity by 7.3 gigawatts. In August, electricity supply fell short of demand by 780 million units, marking the highest shortage since April 2022. The shortage is attributed to poor monsoon, high agricultural demand, and the fall of wind generation. Weather officials expect country-wide rainfall in September to provide some respite. Coal's share in India's power output rose to 74.2% in the eight months ending in August, compared to 72.9% in the same period last year. This is on track for a third consecutive annual increase. In contrast, the share of hydro power fell from 10.9% to 9.2%. Overall power generation has risen significantly, with renewable generation increasing by only 16 billion units compared to over 108 billion units increase in total power generation this year. India failed to achieve its target of installing 175 GW in renewable energy by 2022. The country now aims to boost non-fossil capacity, including solar, wind, nuclear, hydro, and bio-power, to 500 GW by 2030.

The demand for palm oil has led to significant deforestation, and C16 Biosciences aims to reduce the world's reliance on palm oil with their product called Palmless. The yeast is fed on sugars from sugar cane plants, and the process takes less than seven days from start to finish. Palm oil remains the most-produced vegetable oil in the world, accounting for 40% of the total. It is widely used in food and cosmetics due to its smooth texture, natural preservative properties, and ability to maintain its properties under high temperatures. Oil palms produce significantly more oil per hectare compared to other oil crops, making palm oil very productive. Another team led by Professor Chris Chuck at the University of Bath has developed a yeast-sourced alternative to palm oil. The team created a unique strain of yeast called Metschnikowia pulcherrima (MP) that is hardy, can be fed on grass and food waste, and produces high oil yields. The aim is for the oil to be as sustainable as possible, with lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to palm oil.|Lab-grown alternatives aim to cut palm oil dependence|Y|Jan 16, 2023, 12:06 AM|US tech firm C16 Biosciences has released an alternative to palm oil called Palmless, which is created from yeast cells.

The MHD drive has no moving parts and works by generating a magnetic field at a right angle to an electric current, propelling the craft along silently. Engineers have been working on MHD drives for decades, and recent advancements in magnet technology may help solve some of the challenges associated with the drive. While advancements in magnet technology have made the development of a more powerful MHD drive possible, there are still challenges that need to be addressed. One challenge is protecting the electrodes from corrosion when placed in seawater and exposed to an electrical current. Coatings developed by the fuel cell and battery industries may help solve this problem. Another challenge is the resistance and reduced efficiency caused by gas bubbles created on the electrodes when a current is passed across seawater. Potential solutions include gas-diffusing electrodes and techniques to sweep away the bubbles. If the challenges associated with MHD drives can be overcome, the advantages would be significant. MHD drives would require less maintenance than existing propulsion systems due to their lack of moving parts. Additionally, they would be much quieter, which is advantageous for national defense and wildlife preservation.

The FDA advises checking the expiration information for each test on their website before using an expired test. Using expired tests increases the chance of inaccurate results, which could put people's health at risk. Lab PCR tests, the traditional way of detecting Covid, have become more expensive and less accessible for some Americans since the end of the public health emergency in May. This change in coverage by public and private insurers may leave some people unable to get at-home tests for free through their plans. However, certain local health clinics and community sites still offer at-home tests at no cost. The FDA extends expiration dates of at-home Covid tests when manufacturers provide data showing that the tests' shelf life is longer than initially known. The initial expiration dates were sometimes short due to limited data at the time of approval. With more data gathered over time, the stability and sensitivity of these tests can be assessed over longer periods. Existing at-home tests are capable of detecting Covid infections caused by new variants, including the dominant EG.5 strain and other currently circulating variants like omicron. The FDA and experts confirm that at-home tests, as well as tests conducted at medical institutions, hospitals, and other places, recognize these new variants. The FDA also states that existing tests and medications used to treat Covid-19 remain effective against the omicron subvariant BA.2.86.|Can you use expired Covid tests What to know as cases rise new variants emerge|Y|Sep 05, 2023, 02:15 PM|The FDA has extended the expiration dates of popular at-home Covid test products, allowing some old kits to still be safe to use.

Its largest takeover was the $3 billion deal for Beats Electronics in 2014. Unlike Microsoft, which has acquired several companies for billions of dollars, mergers and acquisitions are not in Apple's DNA. For years, there has been speculation about Apple potentially buying Disney, a company with a market valuation of nearly $150 billion. The ties between the two companies are historically strong, with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs becoming Disney's largest individual shareholder after Disney acquired Pixar, owned by Jobs, for $7.4 billion in 2006.

The survey found that 19% of American adults plan to place a bet online or with a bookie, a 56% increase from the previous year. Self-identified NFL fans are expected to place more bets than ever, with a 42% increase from last year. The Supreme Court's decision in 2018 paved the way for states to legalize sports betting, and currently, it is legal in 34 states and Washington D.C. The growth of legal gambling and the ability to place wagers on phones has attracted a flood of users to major players like DraftKings, FanDuel, Caesars, and BetMGM. The NFL has embraced this change and signed five-year deals worth an estimated $1 billion combined with DraftKings, FanDuel, and Caesars to become the league's official sportsbook partners. Sportsbooks are now being integrated into stadiums, with the Washington Commanders, Arizona Cardinals, New York Giants, and Jets having physical sportsbooks either within or outside their venues. NFL owners have also voted to allow sportsbooks to operate on game days in states where sports betting is legal. The NFL has struck deals with companies like Aristocrat to allow NFL-branded slot machines in casinos and has partnered with FanDuel to offer fans $100 off the NFL's Sunday Ticket for placing a small wager. As the NFL adapts to the new normal for gambling, it has experienced growing pains. Player confusion over the league's betting rules has led to multiple suspensions, with at least 10 players being suspended for violating the NFL's gambling policy in the past two years. The league is working to address these issues and ensure clarity for players.

The company reported a net loss of $180 million, compared to a gain of $731 million in the year-ago period. One factor contributing to the loss was the company's settlement of the majority of claims related to the opioid crisis, resulting in a $1.4 billion charge. The slowdown in inflation has had mixed effects on retailers. While higher prices have contributed to overall sales, it has also led to a decline in the volume of merchandise sold. Kroger, which primarily sells groceries, has been less affected by the decline in discretionary merchandise. However, there is a risk that customers may turn to retailers known for lower food prices, such as Walmart, Aldi, or Dollar General. Kroger reaffirmed its full-year guidance but expects lower sales in the back half of the year. The company expects identical sales, excluding fuel, to range between 1% and 2%. However, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip stated that the company expects sales to be at the low end of the range and slightly negative in the second half of the year due to decelerating inflation and a tougher consumer backdrop. Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen mentioned that as inflation slows, the company is starting to see some volume improvement. He also noted that consumer packaged goods companies have become more willing to work with Kroger on pricing. The company has been catering to budget-minded customers with lower-priced items, personalized discounts, fuel rewards, and weekly specials. Kroger announced a deal to divest more than 400 stores and eight distribution centers to C S Wholesale Grocers as part of its effort to complete the merger with Albertsons.

The firm will be divided into five main business lines that report directly to Fraser, eliminating unnecessary complexity and increasing accountability. The changes will also include job cuts, although the exact number has not been decided yet.

While it is not clear if the all-electric version will be based on the current generation of the car or a completely different future model, Reuss hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. This move aligns with GM's plan to produce only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. There have been rumors that the current generation of the Corvette, which features a gasoline engine mounted behind the seats, could be built with a hybrid system. GM President Mark Reuss has previously hinted at the possibility of electrified variants of the car. While it remains uncertain if the hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation, the announcement of an electrified version suggests that GM is exploring different options for the Corvette's powertrain. While most all-electric vehicles in production have been four-door sedans and SUVs, various companies are now working on electric sports cars. Tesla's first car, the Roadster, was an electric sports car, and a second-generation model has been unveiled as a prototype. However, the Corvette would be one of the first iconic American sports cars to offer an electrified version, joining the growing trend of high-performance electric vehicles. Hybrid systems can be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and provide quicker acceleration. Electric motors can deliver power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines, enhancing performance. This technology has been utilized by manufacturers like Ferrari, who have developed hybrid sports cars. The potential hybrid Corvette could leverage hybrid technology to enhance its performance capabilities. General Motors has announced its plan to produce only zero-emission vehicles, including fully electric or hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles, by 2035.

The measures include reducing minimum down payments for mortgages, slashing interest rates on new mortgages, and allowing renegotiation of rates on existing mortgages. This move is expected to benefit 40 million home buyers and impact 25 trillion yuan ($3.5 trillion) in mortgages. After the announcement of the new stimulus measures, several major commercial banks in China, including ICBC, China Construction Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China, have cut their deposit rates. This coordinated move is intended to pave the way for banks to lower their mortgage rates based on the regulators' new requirements. Nomura analysts believe that this action will help boost confidence in the housing market. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has decided to reduce the amount of foreign currency that banks must hold as reserves.

The company attributes its success to new customers, as well as its ability to retain existing customers and increase their spending. Lululemon also raised its expectations for net revenue for the rest of 2023. Dollar General, a discount store, issued a lower sales and profit outlook for the year, citing weaker consumer spending and increasing theft. The company's CEO mentioned that core customers feel financially constrained, possibly due to higher costs of living and cuts in SNAP payments.

The United States experienced high inflation, with the inflation rate peaking at over 9% in June 2022, the highest level in over 40 years. Although inflation has fallen since then, it remains elevated. The increase in prices has led to higher expenses for American households, with one estimate suggesting that the typical household spent $709 more in July 2022 compared to July 2021 for the same goods and services. Despite the impact of inflation, retail spending has held up surprisingly well, supported by a strong labor market.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned employees that non-compliance with the office attendance policy could impact their future at the company. Meta announced that employees assigned to an office must come in three days a week, with noncompliance potentially resulting in disciplinary action. Merck notified employees that office-based positions would require three days on-site, with consequences for non-attendance. According to security provider Kastle Systems, the average occupancy rate in office buildings in the 10 most populous US cities was 47.2% of pre-pandemic levels for the week between August 17 and August 23. This is an increase from the post-pandemic high of just over 50% in early June. Tuesday was the most popular day for employees to show up, with nearly 56% occupancy, while Friday had the lowest occupancy at 31%. A study by workplace analytics firm Basking found that the hours employees spend at work on the days they go into the office may be changing. In the first half of this year, only 55% of office visits on average lasted for more than 6 hours, compared to the pre-pandemic figure of 84%. This suggests a potential shift in work patterns and productivity during in-person office days. Surveys conducted by workplace consulting firms provide insights into the return-to-office policies and enforcement strategies of companies. A live poll survey by Gartner found that 45% of respondents ask employees to come to the office only a few days a week, while only 21% mandate return-to-office policies.

The ban was reportedly communicated to staff through chat groups or meetings. This move could be seen as retaliation for similar actions taken by the US against Chinese tech companies, and it may have a negative impact on Apple and other foreign companies with a presence in China. Even before the formal ban, Chinese officials had been following an unwritten rule of avoiding iPhones for months, as reported by a source familiar with Chinese central government agencies. This suggests that the ban is not entirely surprising and may have been in effect unofficially. The sensitivity of the subject is evident from the source's request to remain anonymous. The ban on iPhones for Chinese government officials could be seen as a response to the US restrictions imposed on Chinese tech companies.

The settlement will compensate users who bought or rented the recalled devices and those who incurred out-of-pocket costs. Philips Respironics did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the agreement. In 2021, Philips recalled about 10.8 million devices used to reduce sound and vibration in CPAP machines. The silicone-based foam used in these devices was found to break down and potentially be inhaled by users. While there have been reports of health issues such as headaches and sinus infections, Philips stated that the potential health risks could range from transient injuries to serious, life-threatening complications. The FDA has received reports alleging at least 385 deaths associated with the breakdown of the foam used in Philips Respironics devices since April 2021. Forty of these reports occurred in the first three months of 2023. Philips Respironics maintains that potential exposure to foam particles or emissions is unlikely to result in significant harm to health. As part of the settlement, Philips will pay awards to users for each recalled device, ranging from $55.63 to $1,552.25. Users will also receive a device return award of $100 for each recalled device returned to the company. Philips has set aside 575 million euros (approximately $615 million) in the first quarter of 2023 to cover the estimated costs.

The Australian Offshore Alliance, representing 500 workers at the Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities, described Chevron's bargaining performance as the most inept effort of any employer in the past 5 years. The industrial action, including work stoppages, has begun and could potentially impact up to 7% of global LNG supplies. News of the breakdown in talks between Chevron and the workers' union has led to a rise in European natural gas prices. Dutch gas futures, which serve as a benchmark for the region, climbed 9.8% on Friday. Europe has become more dependent on global LNG supplies since deliveries of pipeline gas from Russia slumped, and a prolonged disruption to global supplies could further push up prices. The drawn-out dispute at Chevron's LNG facilities in Australia could have significant implications for global LNG supply and competition. The two Chevron sites account for approximately 6% of global supply, and if strikes were to stop production for a month, around 7% of global supply would be wiped out.

This move marks a milestone for the company in adopting universal charging and streamlining the charging process across various devices. The switch is in compliance with the European Union's legislation requiring smartphones and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024. Although Apple has previously switched its iPads and MacBooks to USB-C charging, the company has been resistant to making the change on the iPhone. Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Greg Joswiak, expressed the value and ubiquity of the Lightning charger but acknowledged the need to comply with the EU mandate. The shift to USB-C could generate more e-waste in the short term as people phase out their Lightning cables. Apple has financial reasons for pushing back on the switch to USB-C. The company makes money from selling Lightning cables and accessories, as well as taking a cut from third-party accessories through its Made For iPhone program. Moving to USB-C would reduce Apple's control over its ecosystem, as USB-C is a more open ecosystem. However, Apple could create its own branded USB-C cable to optimize performance and minimize risk and damage to batteries.

The rule applies to image, video, and audio content and is aimed at preventing the spread of election misinformation. The policy update comes as campaign season for the 2024 US presidential election ramps up. Digital information integrity experts have raised alarms about the use of AI-generated text, audio, and video in political advertisements. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology has made it cheap and easy to create convincing AI-generated content, which could lead to a wave of election misinformation. Social media platforms and regulators may be ill-prepared to handle this issue. AI-generated images have already been used in political advertisements. In one example, a video posted by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign used AI-generated images showing former President Donald Trump hugging Dr. Anthony Fauci. The images were designed to criticize Trump and were difficult to spot as AI-generated. The Republican National Committee also released an advertisement using AI images to imagine a dystopian United States after the reelection of President Joe Biden. Google's policy update requires disclosures on ads using synthetic content that could mislead users. Ads with synthetic content that makes it appear as if a person is saying or doing something they didn't say or do would need a label. However, the policy does not apply to synthetic or altered content that is inconsequential to the claims made in the ad, such as image resizing or color corrections. A group of top artificial intelligence companies, including Google, agreed to voluntary commitments to improve safety around their AI technologies. As part of the agreement, the companies will develop technical mechanisms, such as watermarks, to ensure users know when content was generated by AI.

This closure, along with the closure of three other US plants, sparked a six-week strike at GM. The UAW won many of its bargaining goals with the strike, but Lordstown was left without new vehicles to build. Less than a month after settling with the UAW, GM sold the Lordstown plant to Lordstown Motors, an upstart EV truck maker. However, Lordstown Motors faced financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. The factory is now owned by Foxconn, which plans to make EVs for another upstart, Fisker, starting in 2025. In 2019, GM formed a joint venture with Korean manufacturer LG to build batteries for EVs. The joint venture, Ultium Cells, is crucial to GM's plans to shift to an all-EV lineup by 2035. The Ultium plant, which started building batteries last August, now has 1,100 hourly workers who are represented by the UAW. The UAW successfully negotiated a pay increase for workers at the Ultium plant, with starting wages increasing from $16.50 to $20.50 per hour. However, this is still significantly lower than the wages of veteran autoworkers at GM, Ford, and Stellantis plants. The UAW aims to include Ultium workers in GM's national labor agreement in the future. The UAW is currently in contract negotiations with GM, Ford, and Stellantis, seeking pay increases of at least 40%. The contract expires soon, and the union has threatened to go on strike if an agreement is not reached.

He highlighted the rising investments in construction projects by manufacturers as evidence of the growth in blue-collar work. This visit showcased the administration's focus on supporting manufacturing and boosting the economy. The Federal Reserve approved raising interest rates to their highest level in over 22 years, continuing their aggressive inflation-busting campaign. Economists are uncertain about the impact of these rate hikes on the economy.

Additionally, the country's ongoing shift towards renewable energy has sparked a manufacturing boom in the United States. Economists estimate that the industry could add 250,000 jobs over the next two years. Despite the optimism among US consumers, business surveys indicate that the manufacturing sector has been contracting for several months.

This move, prompted by a European regulatory mandate, is largely symbolic as most other gadgets have already switched to USB-C. While it may not significantly reduce e-waste, it is an important step towards creating a common charger across devices and raising awareness about the issue. Retiring the Lightning cable could potentially lead to a surge of e-waste in the short term as iPhone users discard their useless cables. However, the overall impact on global e-waste is expected to be minimal, as charging cables account for only a few hundred thousand tons out of the 66 million tons of electronic waste generated each year. Nevertheless, this transition is an important step in addressing the growing e-waste problem and making people aware of the issue. E-waste is a growing problem that often ends up in closets and junk drawers instead of being properly treated. This leads to the need for more mining of materials like copper, gold, and platinum to produce new products.

Airlines are trying to boost demand during the off-peak season by offering lower prices. Prices to top international destinations, including Europe, are down 31% from summer peaks. Domestic airfare prices for September and October are averaging $211 per ticket, down 29% from average prices in June, July, and August. This drop in prices is typical during the fall shoulder season when demand cools off after the busy summer months. Airlines are slashing prices to incentivize travelers to book trips before the winter holidays. The Federal Reserve is projecting a travel slowdown this fall, as several of its regional districts reported peaking or slowing tourism activity. While international travel saw a surge this summer, the Fed expects a decrease in travel demand during the fall season. This projection aligns with the typical trend of reduced travel after the peak summer months. Frontier Airlines has flagged lower bookings in recent weeks, with sales trending below historical seasonality patterns. As a result, the airline is forecasting an adjusted loss for the quarter. This decrease in bookings could be attributed to the projected travel slowdown and rising fuel prices, which may impact ticket prices. American Airlines has reported a considerable increase in fuel prices since July, which may lead to higher ticket prices. The airline is currently paying about $3 per gallon for jet fuel.
